  requirement: |-
    The solution design and architecture decisions should be managed through a tiered governance process, ultimately leading, if appropriate, to TRG.

    The decision process:

    Decisions should be made at the lowest possible level, with the appropriate stakeholders involved. Considerations include:

    - All decisions should follow local governance processes, such as a programme design authority.
    - If the solution requires assessment against Principles, Policies, Patterns and Standards then presentation to PDG or TRG would be appropriate.
    - At the appropriate stages of the lifecycle, all large items must go to TRG.
    - The relevant Lead Architects and Subject Matter Experts [(SMEs)](https://architecture.digital.nhs.uk/trg/role-of-ccc) should be engaged and supportive.
- code: DM06
  requirement: The overall approach to architecture governance should be appropriate
    and commensurate with the nature of the solution.

  requirement: |-
    **Disaster Recovery & Business Continuity**
