nav_order: 2.56

requirement: |
  Disaster Recovery & Business Continuity There **SHOULD** be clear requirements (commensurate with service levels) around DR & BC (and a pragmatic approach taken with regards DR/BC events planned for). Continuity plans and supporting documentation **SHOULD** reflect the requirements, technical & architecture constraints etc.

more_info: |
  Goal:
    Provide tested continuity & recovery capability proportional to the service
    criticality, minimising downtime & data loss under disruptive events.

  Planning elements:
    - Business Impact Analysis (maps functions -> tolerable outage)
    - Dependency mapping (infra, third parties, data flows)
    - Recovery strategy (cold/warm/hot, active-active)
    - Communication & escalation matrix
    - Tabletop & technical exercise schedule

  Testing patterns:
    - Failover simulation (region / zone outage)
    - Backup restore drill (full & partial datasets)
    - Dependency isolation (simulate provider API failure)
    - Latency degradation scenario

  Pitfalls:
    - Plans drifting from reality (infrastructure evolves, docs stale)
    - Backups untested (restore assumptions invalid)
    - Single person dependency for invocation / orchestration
