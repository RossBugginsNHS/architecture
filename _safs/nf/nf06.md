requirement: |
  Disaster Recovery & Business Continuity There **SHOULD** be clear requirements (commensurate with service levels) around DR & BC (and a pragmatic approach taken with regards DR/BC events planned for). Continuity plans and supporting documentation **SHOULD** reflect the requirements, technical & architecture constraints etc.

  Goal:
    Provide tested continuity & recovery capability proportional to the service
    criticality, minimising downtime & data loss under disruptive events.

  Planning elements:
    - Business Impact Analysis (maps functions -> tolerable outage)
    - Dependency mapping (infra, third parties, data flows)
    - Recovery strategy (cold/warm/hot, active-active)
    - Communication & escalation matrix
    - Tabletop & technical exercise schedule

  Testing patterns:
    - Failover simulation (region / zone outage)
    - Backup restore drill (full & partial datasets)
    - Dependency isolation (simulate provider API failure)
    - Latency degradation scenario

  Pitfalls:
    - Plans drifting from reality (infrastructure evolves, docs stale)
    - Backups untested (restore assumptions invalid)
    - Single person dependency for invocation / orchestration

  Assessment focus:
    Determine if DR/BC plans are realistic, tested and reflect evolving architecture & dependencies.

  Steps:
    1. Review Business Impact Analysis: confirm critical functions & tolerable outage metrics align with stakeholder sign-off.
    2. Examine dependency map / graph: ensure third-party & data flow dependencies current.
    3. Inspect latest recovery test (failover or tabletop) results & remediation status.
    4. Validate backup restore evidence including duration vs RTO / data loss vs RPO.
    5. Assess communication plan clarity & escalation timings; simulate notification path.

  Evidence:
    - BIA excerpt
    - Dependency graph snapshot
    - Recovery exercise report
    - Restore verification log

  Red flags:
    - Out-of-date contact / escalation info
    - Backups passing creation but failing restore
    - Single region critical data with high availability requirement

  Maturity signals:
    - Automated DR drill scheduling & tracking
    - Metrics trend: recovery time improving over drills
    - Dependency risk scoring integrated into planning

  Quick improvements:
    - Introduce quarterly mini-restore test for key datasets
    - Automate dependency inventory extraction
    - Add RTO/RPO compliance dashboard

assessment_examples:
  "0":
    - example: No documented DR plan; backups assumed but unverified; single region dependency for critical data.
    - example: Recovery efforts in prior incident improvised with long MTTR.
  "1":
    - example: Basic runbook draft exists; RTO/RPO aspirational without measurement; manual backup restore attempted once.
    - example: Contact / escalation list outdated or incomplete.
  "2":
    - example: BIA completed; quarterly tabletop exercise performed but lacking follow-up action tracking.
    - example: Some restore tests executed; timing not compared to targets.
  "3":
    - example: Regular failover simulations produce metrics; remediation tasks tracked and closed.
    - example: Dependency map current; backup restore success measured against RTO/RPO.
  "4":
    - example: Automated scheduling of recovery drills; improvements show downward RTO trend and reduced data loss window.
    - example: Risk-based scenario selection ensures coverage of top dependency failures.
  "5":
    - example: Continuous verification (chaos-style) of key recovery paths in pre-prod; predictive risk scoring adjusts test focus.
    - example: DR posture dashboards consumed by leadership; dynamic runbooks auto-updated from infrastructure metadata.
