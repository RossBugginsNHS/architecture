requirement: |
    Solutions **MUST** incorporate workload observability, understand service health, and respond to events  

more_info: |
  Intent:
    Provide deep visibility into system behaviour so teams can detect anomalies,
    triage rapidly, and drive continuous improvement.

  Observability pillars:
    - Metrics: RED/USE (Rate, Errors, Duration / Utilisation, Saturation, Errors)
    - Logs: structured, contextual, correlation IDs
    - Traces: distributed spans across service boundaries
    - Events: domain and audit events for business insight

  Implementation essentials:
    - Standard logging schema (timestamp, service, requestId, userRef)
    - Propagate correlation context (trace/span IDs) end-to-end
    - SLO definition: target, measurement window, error budget policy
    - Alert design: symptom not cause, actionable, owned

  Maturity indicators:
    - < 5% noisy / unactionable alerts
    - MTTR trending down quarter-on-quarter
    - Error budget burn informs release pace
    - Trace sampling adaptive (high fidelity for errors)

  Pitfalls:
    - Oversampling everything -> cost / signal dilution
    - Chatty log statements lacking structure
    - Alerts on raw infrastructure metrics without user impact context
