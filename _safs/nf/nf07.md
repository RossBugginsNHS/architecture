dimension: non functional
tags: [accessibility,legislation]
nav_order: 2.57

requirement: |
  The architecture **MUST** support the ability to maximise the UX and supports accessibility needs and legislation. 

more_info: |
  Intent:
    Ensure architecture supports accessible, inclusive user experience meeting
    legislative and ethical standards while maintaining product velocity.

  Accessibility integration:
    - Shift-left design reviews with assistive tech personas
    - Component library with baked-in accessibility (semantic markup, ARIA)
    - Continuous automated a11y scans + manual audits for complex flows
    - Performance budgets (fast response benefits accessibility)
    - Internationalisation & localisation readiness

  Metrics / signals:
    - % components with accessibility test coverage
    - Defect density of a11y issues per release
    - Keyboard-only navigation journey success rate
    - Colour contrast compliance %

  Pitfalls:
    - Treating accessibility as post-hoc compliance check
    - Reliance solely on automated scanners (they miss contextual issues)
    - Custom widgets reinventing native control semantics
