requirement: |
  An overall volume and performance model **SHOULD** exist and includes business-realistic exceptional scenarios.

  Intent:
    Understand and validate system performance characteristics under expected
    and exceptional business scenarios to prevent capacity shocks.

  Model components:
    - Workload taxonomy (transaction types, payload size distribution)
    - Growth projections (seasonal, campaign-driven, organic)
    - Bottleneck analysis (CPU, IO, network, external APIs)
    - Exceptional scenarios (outbreak spike, regulatory deadline surge)

  Validation cycle:
    1. Baseline benchmark & profiling
    2. Stress / soak / spike tests
    3. Performance budget enforcement (pipeline checks)
    4. Regression tracking (capacity vs release deltas)

  Pitfalls:
    - Chasing synthetic benchmarks misaligned to real usage mix
    - One-off load test before go-live only
    - Excessive headroom (wasted cost) due to lack of auto-scaling confidence
