  Methods to measure sustainability to establish baseline and show improvement **SHOULD** be defined.

  Goal:
    Measure and reduce environmental impact (energy, carbon) of the solution
    while balancing performance, cost and reliability.

  Sustainability levers:
    - Right-sizing & autoscaling (avoid idle capacity)
    - Efficient data lifecycle (tiering, deletion, compression)
    - Energy-aware workload scheduling (off-peak batch)
    - Hardware efficiency (arm64 / efficient instance families)
    - Code efficiency (algorithmic improvements reducing CPU cycles)

  Metrics:
    - kWh or carbon per transaction / user / dataset processed
    - Storage growth vs retention policy compliance
    - Idle time ratio per service
    - Cost-to-carbon correlation trend

  Pitfalls:
    - Optimising carbon w/o safeguarding latency SLOs
    - Retaining unreferenced data indefinitely
    - Ignoring embodied carbon of premature hardware refresh cycles

  Assessment focus:
    Verify sustainability metrics, baselines and improvement actions exist and are integrated with performance & cost considerations.

  Steps:
    1. Review carbon / energy intensity metric definition: confirm numerator/denominator and data source provenance.
    2. Check recent trend vs baseline; correlate improvement actions (right-sizing, lifecycle policies) to metric shifts.
    3. Inspect storage lifecycle policies: sample dataset retention / deletion evidence.
    4. Evaluate autoscaling efficiency: utilisation vs idle ratio over representative period.
    5. Confirm sustainability actions considered in optimisation ADRs (not cost-only trade-offs).

  Evidence:
    - Carbon intensity dashboard screenshot
    - Lifecycle policy application log
    - Autoscaling utilisation graph
    - Optimisation ADR referencing energy impact

  Red flags:
    - Sustainability metrics absent or vanity (no normalisation)
    - Data hoarding (no deletion records) inflating footprint
    - Optimisations increasing carbon without documented trade-off decision

  Maturity signals:
    - Sustainability KPI part of release readiness review
    - Automated detection of idle over-provisioned resources
    - Cross-correlation report cost vs carbon vs performance

  Quick improvements:
    - Add carbon_estimate script referencing usage metrics
    - Implement tiering for cold data sets
    - Introduce sustainability section in ADR template
