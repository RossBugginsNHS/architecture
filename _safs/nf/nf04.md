  Goal:
    Measure and reduce environmental impact (energy, carbon) of the solution
    while balancing performance, cost and reliability.

  Sustainability levers:
    - Right-sizing & autoscaling (avoid idle capacity)
    - Efficient data lifecycle (tiering, deletion, compression)
    - Energy-aware workload scheduling (off-peak batch)
    - Hardware efficiency (arm64 / efficient instance families)
    - Code efficiency (algorithmic improvements reducing CPU cycles)

  Metrics:
    - kWh or carbon per transaction / user / dataset processed
    - Storage growth vs retention policy compliance
    - Idle time ratio per service
    - Cost-to-carbon correlation trend

  Pitfalls:
    - Optimising carbon w/o safeguarding latency SLOs
    - Retaining unreferenced data indefinitely
    - Ignoring embodied carbon of premature hardware refresh cycles
