requirement: |
  Reliability & Resilience needs **SHOULD** be defined (in terms of standard NHS England service levels) and solution mechanisms to meet these needs are defined including metrics such as Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO).

more_info: |
  Goal:
    Explicitly define resilience objectives and engineer mechanisms to meet them
    under realistic failure and load scenarios.

  Reliability constructs:
    - SLO / SLI pairs (availability, latency, durability)
    - Error budget & policy (throttle release pace vs burn)
    - Failure mode catalogue (dependency outage, network partition, overload)
    - Recovery targets: RTO (service restore), RPO (data loss window)

  Engineering tactics:
    - Redundancy (multi-AZ / region replication)
    - Graceful degradation (feature toggles, read-only fallbacks)
    - Backpressure & circuit breaking
    - Idempotent & retry-safe operations
    - Chaos experiments validating assumptions

  Pitfalls:
    - Overstated availability targets without cost justification
    - Requiring 0 data loss without replication strategy
    - Ignoring partial failure (latency spikes) focusing only on hard downtime

assessment_guidance: |
  Assessment focus:
    Verify resilience objectives are quantified, engineered, tested, and iteratively improved.

  Steps:
    1. Inspect reliability doc: confirm SLO/SLI, RTO, RPO and failure mode catalog exist with owner & review date.
    2. Sample chaos experiment or failover test report: verify objective vs actual metrics & follow-up actions.
    3. Check circuit breaker / retry metrics for a high-risk dependency (error rates, fallback success).
    4. Review error budget utilisation trend & any release gating decisions.
    5. Examine backlog for open resilience actions: ensure prioritised proportional to risk.

  Evidence:
    - Reliability objectives excerpt
    - Chaos / failover test log
    - Circuit breaker metric panel screenshot
    - Error budget burn chart

  Red flags:
    - Undefined or unrealistic RTO/RPO (aspirational only)
    - No recent validation of backup restore capability
    - Repeated incident theme without architectural mitigation plan

  Maturity signals:
    - Automated resilience test suite integrated into pipeline or schedule
    - Data-driven prioritisation of resilience work via risk scoring
    - Error budget burn influencing change freeze triggers

  Quick improvements:
    - Add failure_mode_id tagging to incidents & ADRs
    - Establish monthly mini-chaos drill
    - Implement resilience backlog dashboard
