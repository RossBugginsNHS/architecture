nav_order: 2.52

requirement: |
  Reliability & Resilience needs **SHOULD** be defined (in terms of standard NHS England service levels) and solution mechanisms to meet these needs are defined including metrics such as Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO).

  Goal:
    Explicitly define resilience objectives and engineer mechanisms to meet them
    under realistic failure and load scenarios.

  Reliability constructs:
    - SLO / SLI pairs (availability, latency, durability)
    - Error budget & policy (throttle release pace vs burn)
    - Failure mode catalogue (dependency outage, network partition, overload)
    - Recovery targets: RTO (service restore), RPO (data loss window)

  Engineering tactics:
    - Redundancy (multi-AZ / region replication)
    - Graceful degradation (feature toggles, read-only fallbacks)
    - Backpressure & circuit breaking
    - Idempotent & retry-safe operations
    - Chaos experiments validating assumptions

  Pitfalls:
    - Overstated availability targets without cost justification
    - Requiring 0 data loss without replication strategy
    - Ignoring partial failure (latency spikes) focusing only on hard downtime
