description: Reuse Potential
dimension: reuse
tags: [reuse]
nav_order: 2.62

requirement: |
  For new capabilities we **SHOULD** identify/recognise the potential reuse opportunities which may drive design decisions, benefits etc.

  Goal:
    Intentionally design new capabilities with future reuse potentialâ€”balancing
    generality and time-to-value.

  Reuse design heuristics:
    - Clear domain boundary & contract (avoid leaking internal concepts)
    - Configuration over code for variability
    - Idempotent, side-effect predictable operations
    - Extensible data schema (forward-compatible fields)
    - Observability exposing meaningful consumer metrics

  Identification process:
    1. Map capability to enterprise capability model
    2. Identify adjacent programmes with similar emerging needs
    3. Classify reuse likelihood (High / Medium / Low)
    4. Adjust abstraction level accordingly (YAGNI guardrails)

  Pitfalls:
    - Over-abstracting for hypothetical consumers
    - Embedding tenant-specific logic early
    - No discoverability (capability hidden in monolith internals)

  Assessment focus:
    Determine if new capability design balances immediate needs with pragmatic future reuse potential (avoiding speculative over-abstraction).

  Steps:
    1. Review capability specification: confirm boundary & anti-goals explicitly listed.
    2. Evaluate reuse likelihood classification & rationale vs market / internal demand signals.
    3. Inspect API / contract: ensure no tenant-specific logic or custom field proliferation.
    4. Check extension mechanism clarity (hooks, config) and absence of premature plugin complexity.
    5. Trace one potential external consumer pathway & identify missing abstraction layers (if any).

  Evidence:
    - Specification excerpt
    - Reuse likelihood matrix row
    - Contract snippet illustrating neutrality
    - Extension mechanism overview

  Red flags:
    - Generic interface with no current consumer and high maintenance cost
    - Hard-coded tenant configs disguised as general features
    - Lack of performance / scalability considerations for reuse scenario

  Maturity signals:
    - Reuse adoption metrics (calls, consumers) tracked & informing roadmap
    - Intentional de-scoping decisions captured with revisit triggers
    - Versioning strategy supporting additive evolution

  Quick improvements:
    - Add anti-goals section to spec
    - Introduce consumer feedback capture form
    - Implement contract linter for tenant leakage

assessment_examples:
  '0': |
    - Capability built narrowly with no reuse consideration.
      - Reuse mentioned; boundary & anti-goals unclear.
  '2': |
    - Specification & likelihood matrix exist; abstraction moderate.
      - Reuse metrics tracked; extension points documented; no tenant leakage.
  '4': |
    - Consumer feedback loop influencing roadmap; additive evolution smooth.
      - Adaptive abstraction levels tuned via adoption analytics & controlled experiments.
