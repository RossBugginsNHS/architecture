dimension: reuse

nav_order: 2.62

requirement: |
  For new capabilities we **SHOULD** identify/recognise the potential reuse opportunities which may drive design decisions, benefits etc.

  Goal:
    Intentionally design new capabilities with future reuse potentialâ€”balancing
    generality and time-to-value.

  Reuse design heuristics:
    - Clear domain boundary & contract (avoid leaking internal concepts)
    - Configuration over code for variability
    - Idempotent, side-effect predictable operations
    - Extensible data schema (forward-compatible fields)
    - Observability exposing meaningful consumer metrics

  Identification process:
    1. Map capability to enterprise capability model
    2. Identify adjacent programmes with similar emerging needs
    3. Classify reuse likelihood (High / Medium / Low)
    4. Adjust abstraction level accordingly (YAGNI guardrails)

  Pitfalls:
    - Over-abstracting for hypothetical consumers
    - Embedding tenant-specific logic early
    - No discoverability (capability hidden in monolith internals)
