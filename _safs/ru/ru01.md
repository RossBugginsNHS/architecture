description: Square Peg Round Hole
dimension: reuse
tags: [capabilities,existing]
nav_order: 2.61

requirement: |
  If reusing existing capabilities, we **SHOULD** have confidence that any additional functionality required can be sensibly and cost effectively added to the existing service i.e. we are not bending something out of shape.

more_info: |
  Intent:
    Avoid contorting existing services beyond their intended operating / domain
    boundaries leading to fragile extensions and escalating maintenance burden.

  Evaluation checklist:
    - Functional gap analysis (features required vs provided)
    - Non-functional fit (latency, throughput, data sensitivity)
    - Extensibility path (plugin / config vs code fork)
    - Ownership & roadmap alignment
    - Upgrade / change cadence compatibility

  Fit indicators:
    - New requirements fall within published extension mechanisms
    - Performance headroom > projected 12â€“18 month growth
    - Roadmap includes upcoming needed capabilities

  Misfit signals:
    - Multiple invasive forks / patches required
    - Latency budget exceeded after extension spikes path length
    - Service owner unwilling to absorb additional scope

  Pitfalls:
    - Underestimating cost of supporting divergent bespoke branch
    - Silent SLA erosion due to capacity squeeze
    - Hidden coupling to internal data models not meant for external use
