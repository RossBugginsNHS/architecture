description: Square Peg Round Hole
dimension: reuse
tags: [capabilities,existing]
nav_order: 2.61

requirement: |
  If reusing existing capabilities, we **SHOULD** have confidence that any additional functionality required can be sensibly and cost effectively added to the existing service i.e. we are not bending something out of shape.

more_info: |
  Intent:
    Avoid contorting existing services beyond their intended operating / domain
    boundaries leading to fragile extensions and escalating maintenance burden.

  Evaluation checklist:
    - Functional gap analysis (features required vs provided)
    - Non-functional fit (latency, throughput, data sensitivity)
    - Extensibility path (plugin / config vs code fork)
    - Ownership & roadmap alignment
    - Upgrade / change cadence compatibility

  Fit indicators:
    - New requirements fall within published extension mechanisms
    - Performance headroom > projected 12–18 month growth
    - Roadmap includes upcoming needed capabilities

  Misfit signals:
    - Multiple invasive forks / patches required
    - Latency budget exceeded after extension spikes path length
    - Service owner unwilling to absorb additional scope

  Pitfalls:
    - Underestimating cost of supporting divergent bespoke branch
    - Silent SLA erosion due to capacity squeeze
    - Hidden coupling to internal data models not meant for external use

assessment_guidance: |
  Assessment focus:
    Confirm reuse of existing capability is structurally sound (not over-stretching) with lifecycle viability.

  Steps:
    1. Examine gap analysis: verify each significant extension requirement has a clear supported mechanism (plugin/config API) or justified workaround.
    2. Review performance headroom metrics post-extension vs projected load curve.
    3. Inspect ownership & roadmap alignment: confirm future needs appear on owning team's backlog.
    4. Assess operational risk: support model & incident history—any degradation since extension adoption?
    5. Evaluate exit/rollback plan if extension stress exceeds acceptable limits.

  Evidence:
    - Gap analysis table excerpt
    - Headroom chart
    - Roadmap / backlog item references
    - Extension ADR with constraints

  Red flags:
    - Forked codebase divergence increasing maintenance cost
    - Latency or error SLO regression attributable to contorted usage
    - Owner rejection of requested core enhancements (accumulating patchwork)

  Maturity signals:
    - Extension request turnaround times tracked & improving
    - Periodic reassessment of fit vs emerging alternatives
    - Observability distinguishing base vs extended features

  Quick improvements:
    - Introduce extension fit checklist gating further customisation
    - Add extension stress test scenario
    - Formalise escalation path for capability gaps
