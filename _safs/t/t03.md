description: Vendor Locks

requirement: |
  An appraisal **SHOULD** be made of any vendor lock considerations and associated risks, and these are understood and accepted/mitigated.

more_info: |
  Intent:
    Identify current & potential vendor lock factors early, quantify risk and
    apply proportionate mitigation (or conscious acceptance) strategies.

  Lock-in dimensions:
    - Proprietary data formats / APIs
    - Operational tooling & ecosystem maturity
    - Migration / exit cost (data egress, rewrite effort)
    - Contractual clauses (termination, price escalation)
    - Skills exclusivity (few engineers trained)

  Assessment model:
    - Score each dimension (Low / Med / High)
    - Determine aggregate risk posture
    - Select mitigation pattern (abstraction, standardisation, lifecycle horizon)

  Mitigation patterns:
    - Portable abstraction layer (interface / facade)
    - Data export / replication to open format
    - Multi-provider proof-of-concept (only if justified)
    - Time-boxed adoption (sunset review point)

  Pitfalls:
    - Over-mitigating (unnecessary complexity for low-value workloads)
    - Ignoring switching triggers (cost, scale, compliance changes)
    - Assuming open source automatically removes lock-in (hidden expertise cost)

assessment_guidance: |
  Assessment focus:
    Determine quality of vendor lock risk appraisal & proportional mitigation.

  Steps:
    1. Open lock-in risk matrix: verify dimensions scored & justification text present (not default placeholders).
    2. Sample mitigation strategy (e.g. abstraction layer): confirm implementation exists (code / interface) and not purely aspirational.
    3. Examine exit simulation evidence (export / restore test) for high-risk vendors.
    4. Check contract repository for renewal/price escalation triggers & monitoring.
    5. Identify any over-mitigation causing unnecessary complexity (ask for rationale / cost-benefit).

  Evidence:
    - Risk matrix excerpt
    - Abstraction layer repo / interface file
    - Exit simulation log
    - Contract trigger calendar entry

  Red flags:
    - High aggregate risk with no mitigation plan
    - Stale mitigations untested for >12 months
    - Abstraction layer leaking vendor specifics (false neutrality)

  Maturity signals:
    - Scheduled exit drill outcomes & improvements tracked
    - Automated alert for contract renewal windows
    - Quantified switching cost updated periodically

  Quick improvements:
    - Add exit_success metric (time & data completeness)
    - Define minimal abstraction boundary guidelines
    - Integrate price change monitoring feed

assessment_examples:
  "0":
    - example: Vendor lock risks not assessed; dependence discovered reactively.
    - example: No exit strategy or mitigation recorded.
  "1":
    - example: Informal notes on vendor risk; matrix incomplete; mitigations conceptual.
    - example: No exit simulation performed.
  "2":
    - example: Risk matrix populated with qualitative scores; initial abstraction layer defined.
    - example: One-off export test planned but not executed.
  "3":
    - example: Periodic exit simulation executed; abstraction layer enforced via interface boundaries.
    - example: Renewal & price escalation triggers tracked.
  "4":
    - example: Automated alerts for contract windows; switching cost model updated.
    - example: Mitigation effectiveness reviewed; obsolete mitigations simplified.
  "5":
    - example: Continuous lock risk scoring; proactive renegotiation or diversification actions triggered.
    - example: Exit simulations produce time & completeness metrics trending positive.
