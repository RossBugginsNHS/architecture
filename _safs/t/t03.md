description: Vendor Locks

requirement: |
  An appraisal **SHOULD** be made of any vendor lock considerations and associated risks, and these are understood and accepted/mitigated.

more_info: |
  Intent:
    Identify current & potential vendor lock factors early, quantify risk and
    apply proportionate mitigation (or conscious acceptance) strategies.

  Lock-in dimensions:
    - Proprietary data formats / APIs
    - Operational tooling & ecosystem maturity
    - Migration / exit cost (data egress, rewrite effort)
    - Contractual clauses (termination, price escalation)
    - Skills exclusivity (few engineers trained)

  Assessment model:
    - Score each dimension (Low / Med / High)
    - Determine aggregate risk posture
    - Select mitigation pattern (abstraction, standardisation, lifecycle horizon)

  Mitigation patterns:
    - Portable abstraction layer (interface / facade)
    - Data export / replication to open format
    - Multi-provider proof-of-concept (only if justified)
    - Time-boxed adoption (sunset review point)

  Pitfalls:
    - Over-mitigating (unnecessary complexity for low-value workloads)
    - Ignoring switching triggers (cost, scale, compliance changes)
    - Assuming open source automatically removes lock-in (hidden expertise cost)
