description: SaaS First 

requirement: |
    We **SHOULD** be adopting cloud managed services over IaaS and any exceptions require close governance. 

more_info: |
  Goal:
    Prefer SaaS / managed and serverless services where they meet functional &
    non-functional needs, enabling focus on differentiating value instead of
    commodity platform operation.

  Assessment criteria:
    - Functional fit & configurability vs required customisation
    - Reliability & SLA coverage vs service level objectives
    - Data residency / compliance & security model (shared responsibility review)
    - Cost elasticity & predictability
    - Exit / portability considerations

  Adoption approach:
    1. Map requirement set to SaaS feature matrix
    2. Identify gaps & potential compensating controls
    3. Evaluate cost vs build/run alternative
    4. Define usage & scaling guardrails (quotas, budgets)
    5. Formalise exception if choosing self-managed alternative

  Pitfalls:
    - Building wrappers that negate managed service benefits
    - Accepting opaque vendor roadmaps without contingency
    - Overlooking shared responsibility gaps (backup, identity integration)

assessment_guidance: |
  Assessment focus:
    Verify SaaS / managed service adoption decisions are evidence-based with governance over exceptions and shared responsibility clarity.

  Steps:
    1. Review fit-gap analysis: ensure each gap has mitigation (config, workaround, compensating control) or justified rejection.
    2. Inspect cost model vs self-managed option including ops toil & risk-adjusted factors.
    3. Validate shared responsibility matrix: list which controls remain on the team (backups, identity, data classification).
    4. Check exception register for any self-managed choices: verify rationale & revisit date.
    5. Evaluate monitoring: does telemetry cover vendor SLA metrics & internal KPIs? Sample dashboard.

  Evidence:
    - Fit-gap table excerpt
    - Cost comparison snapshot
    - Shared responsibility matrix
    - Exception record

  Red flags:
    - SaaS adoption with undefined data residency assertion
    - Self-managed path lacking total cost calculation
    - Missing exit plan for critical SaaS dependency

  Maturity signals:
    - Periodic SaaS value realisation review (utilisation vs plan)
    - Automated SLA breach alerts correlated with vendor contract
    - Exit simulation for tier-1 SaaS services

  Quick improvements:
    - Add responsibility_matrix.yaml validated in CI
    - Introduce vendor performance monthly scorecard
    - Define exit readiness checklist
