description: SaaS First 

requirement: |
    We **SHOULD** be adopting cloud managed services over IaaS and any exceptions require close governance. 

more_info: |
  Goal:
    Prefer SaaS / managed and serverless services where they meet functional &
    non-functional needs, enabling focus on differentiating value instead of
    commodity platform operation.

  Assessment criteria:
    - Functional fit & configurability vs required customisation
    - Reliability & SLA coverage vs service level objectives
    - Data residency / compliance & security model (shared responsibility review)
    - Cost elasticity & predictability
    - Exit / portability considerations

  Adoption approach:
    1. Map requirement set to SaaS feature matrix
    2. Identify gaps & potential compensating controls
    3. Evaluate cost vs build/run alternative
    4. Define usage & scaling guardrails (quotas, budgets)
    5. Formalise exception if choosing self-managed alternative

  Pitfalls:
    - Building wrappers that negate managed service benefits
    - Accepting opaque vendor roadmaps without contingency
    - Overlooking shared responsibility gaps (backup, identity integration)
