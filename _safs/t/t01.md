description: Technology Radar

requirement: |
  Technology choices **SHOULD** be made in line with the NHS England Technology Radar, corporate direction and wider industry trends using the associated processes to support decision making. (Note there are overlaps with the Engineering red lines; ensure a consistent response and do not repeat assessments)

  Intent:
    Align technology adoption with organisational direction, maturity posture and
    ecosystem evolution—avoiding fragmentation and costly divergence.

  Radar usage:
    - Map candidate tech to radar ring (Adopt / Trial / Assess / Hold)
    - Justify movement between rings via evaluation outcomes
    - Flag exceptions (using non-adopt tech) with rationale & exit plan

  Evaluation dimensions:
    - Strategic fit & principle alignment
    - Ecosystem support (skills, tooling, community, vendor viability)
    - Operability (observability, upgrade path, resilience story)
    - Security & compliance posture
    - Total cost of ownership & lock-in profile

  Pitfalls:
    - Cargo-cult adoption based on hype curves
    - Over-customising platform tech (hard to upgrade)
    - Hidden dependency sprawl (plugins, proprietary extensions)

examples: 
    - title: Radar Entry Justification
      content: |
        Technology X moved to Trial: pilot success criteria defined (latency < 50ms, admin overhead < 1 FTE).
    - title: Exception Record
      content: |
        Using "Hold" tech Y due to existing contractual dependency; plan to retire by Q3.
    - title: Comparative Evaluation Table
      content: |
        Columns: Candidate, Operability Score, Security Score, Cost, Decision.

technology:
    - title: Tech Radar Repository / Tool
      content: |
        Stores ring assignments & history (e.g. YAML + static site).
    - title: Evaluation Template (Markdown)
      content: |
        Standardises evidence capture & scoring.
    - title: Skills Inventory Dashboard
      content: |
        Correlates workforce capability with adoption risk.
