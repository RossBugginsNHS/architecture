description: Change Control
dimension: documentation
tags: [documentation,change control]
nav_order: 2.74

requirement: |
    There **MUST** be an appropriate change control mechanism for architecture documentation  

more_info: |
  Objective:
    Provide traceable, reviewable evolution of architecture artefacts so that
    stakeholders understand intent shifts and can audit rationale.

  Minimum characteristics of change control:
    - Version history (immutable log, ability to diff)
    - Peer review / approval workflow before merge (at least one qualified reviewer)
    - Linkage to originating driver (ticket / incident / request / decision)
    - Automated checks (lint, metadata completeness, formatting)
    - Rollback capability

  Workflow (docs-as-code pattern):
    1. Propose change via branch or draft page
    2. Update related decisions / diagrams concurrently
    3. Submit Pull Request referencing issue / decision ID
    4. Automated validation (schema, broken links, freshness metadata)
    5. Reviewer(s) provide structured feedback
    6. Approval & merge triggers site regeneration / publishing

  Roles:
    - Author: Prepares change & impact summary
    - Reviewer: Validates correctness, consistency & governance alignment
    - Custodian: Ensures metadata & cross-links updated (can be automated)

  Evidence you can show:
    - PR with linked issue and ADR update
    - Audit log showing who approved and when
    - Generated changelog entry / release note snippet

  Pitfalls:
    - Editing diagrams out-of-band (losing provenance)
    - Bypassing review for "minor" wording—eventually diverges in substance
    - Single-person dominance (no shared understanding)

examples: 
    - title: Pull Request With Linked ADR
      content: |
        PR #123 updates logical architecture diagram and ADR-045 status to
        "Accepted" including impact notes; reviewers: solution architect & ops.
    - title: Automated Changelog Generation
      content: |
        Pipeline job appends summary line to CHANGELOG.md capturing scope.
    - title: Review Checklist Comment
      content: |
        Structured reviewer comment verifying: links ok, metadata ok, decisions updated.

technology:
    - title: Git / Pull Requests
      content: |
        Core mechanism for diff, review, approval and merge traceability.
    - title: CI Pipeline (lint & build)
      content: |
        Ensures consistency & fails fast on format or schema issues.
    - title: Diagram-as-Code Tools
      content: |
        Ensures diagrams participate in same change control (PlantUML / Mermaid).
    - title: Changelog Automation Script
      content: |
        Generates release notes from merged PR metadata.

assessment_guidance: |
  How to assess:
    1. Review 3 recent doc changes: ensure PRs reference issues / decisions & received peer review (not self‑merged).
    2. Confirm automated checks (lint, link validation, schema) run on PR and block merge on failure.
    3. Inspect change log: are material architecture changes summarised? Missing entries → discoverability risk.
    4. Evaluate rollback: is previous version recoverable easily (git history, tags)?
    5. Check decision + doc sync: a new ADR should coincide with related diagram / model updates.

  Evidence:
    - Sample PR links with review comments resolved.
    - CI pipeline run illustrating validations.
    - Changelog / release notes snippet.
    - Audit trail for rejected proposal (ensures transparency, not deletion).

  Warning signs:
    - Force-pushed or squashed history removing review context.
    - Large binary diagram files updated without explanation.
    - Direct edits on main branch bypassing governance.

  Maturity markers:
    - Pre-merge checklist automated (status checks all green).
    - <5% of PRs merged without peer review (justified exceptions only).
    - Template enforced for PR description referencing artefact IDs.

  Quick wins:
    - Introduce PR template with sections: Context, Linked ADRs, Impact, Verification.
    - Add link-check + front matter validation to CI.
    - Auto-generate changelog line from merged PR title.
