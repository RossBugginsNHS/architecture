description: Open by Default
dimension: documentation
tags: [open source,open]
nav_order: 2.72

requirement: |
  Documentation **SHOULD** be published "open by default" and exceptions handled according to policy i.e. sensitivity etc.

more_info: |
  Intent:
    Maximise reuse, scrutiny and collaboration by publishing architecture
    artefacts openly unless a clearly defined sensitivity (personal data,
    security posture, commercial) justifies restriction.

  Open-by-default decision flow:
    1. Classify content: public / internal only / restricted
    2. If not public, record rationale & expiry / review date
    3. Provide a redacted public-friendly variant if feasible
    4. Index still lists restricted artefacts showing meta (title, owner)

  Benefits:
    - Reduces duplication—other teams discover prior solutions & patterns
    - Encourages earlier peer review and challenge
    - Builds trust through transparency of rationale & constraints

  Required controls:
    - Sensitivity labelling (e.g. banner or front matter classification)
    - Access control aligned to corporate policy & least privilege
    - Redaction pipeline (removes secrets, credentials, explicit IP ranges)
    - Review cadence ensuring restricted classification remains justified

  Evidence examples:
    - Classification register mapping each doc to a sensitivity level
    - Redacted and full versions stored side-by-side with hash / version
    - Access logs or permission matrix for restricted spaces

  Pitfalls:
    - Over-classification through precaution (defaulting to private)
    - Publishing diagrams without pruning sensitive node attributes
    - Divergence between public & internal versions (no sync workflow)

examples: 
    - title: Classification Register Entry
      content: |
        Table row: (Doc ID, Title, Classification, Rationale, Review Date, Owner)
        showing evidence of time-bounded restriction.
    - title: Redacted Architecture Overview
      content: |
        Public version removing specific IPs / credentials while preserving
        component relationships and data flows.
    - title: Access Permission Matrix
      content: |
        YAML / table defining groups with read vs write for each documentation area.

technology:
    - title: Confluence with Space Permissions
      content: |
        Implements coarse access control & page-level restrictions.
    - title: GitHub Public / Internal Repos
      content: |
        Open markdown & decision records, issues for transparent discussion.
    - title: Static Site Generator (Jekyll / MkDocs)
      content: |
        Produces a publicly browseable version from markdown sources.
    - title: DLP / Secret Scanning
      content: |
        Automated detection prevents leaking credentials when opening content.

assessment_guidance: |
  How to assess:
    1. Inspect classification register (or equivalent). Confirm every architecture artefact is tagged Public / Internal / Restricted with rationale.
    2. For 2 restricted items: validate a review date & consider if redacted public version exists.
    3. Confirm a redaction / secret scanning process before publication (tooling or documented checklist).
    4. Ensure index still lists restricted artefacts (at least metadata) for discoverability.
    5. Check that open artefacts avoid inadvertent disclosure (sample for IPs / credentials / personal data references).

  Evidence:
    - Classification table extract.
    - Example redacted vs full doc diff.
    - Secret scan / DLP pipeline log.
    - Policy or SOP describing exception approval / renewal.

  Questions:
    - What triggers reclassification (e.g. project phase change)?
    - How are secrets prevented from entering repos / pages?
    - Is there an appeals or challenge process for a “private” label?

  Anti‑patterns:
    - Blanket internal classification “just in case”.
    - Redacted version lags behind canonical.
    - Untracked sharing through ad‑hoc email attachments.

  Maturity cues:
    - Automated nightly secret scan with zero critical findings outstanding.
    - Restricted items < 15% unless justified by domain.
    - Time‑boxed exceptions with upcoming review surfaced on dashboard.

  Quick wins:
    - Introduce simple YAML front matter key: classification & review_date.
    - Add secret scanning (trufflehog / gitleaks) to CI.
    - Publish an “Open Artefact Checklist” for contributors.
    
assessment_examples:
  '0':
    - example: No classification; all documentation private by default without recorded rationale.
    - example: Sensitive details (credentials, IPs) occasionally present in shared docs; no scanning.
    - example: No redacted versions; openness decided ad‑hoc per request.
  '1':
    - example: Informal rule-of-thumb for openness; few artefacts publicly visible.
    - example: Manual one-off redaction performed without repeatable process.
    - example: Secrets sometimes discovered post-publication and removed manually.
  '2':
    - example: Draft classification register covering subset (<50%) of artefacts.
    - example: Some redacted copies published; majority still internal-only.
    - example: Manual / occasional secret scanning; not part of CI.
  '3':
    - example: Majority artefacts classified with rationale & review dates; restricted list shrinking.
    - example: Redaction guidelines documented; new docs assessed before merge.
    - example: Automated secret scan on each merge; low false-positive overhead.
  '4':
    - example: ">90% eligible artefacts open or redacted; dashboard highlights upcoming restriction reviews."
    - example: Redaction pipeline scripted & consistent; diff between full and redacted tracked.
    - example: Restricted percentage trending downward quarter-on-quarter.
  '5':
    - example: Open-by-default gated in CI (must supply classification + rationale if restricted).
    - example: All restricted items have active review schedule; no expired rationales.
    - example: Automated redaction + secret scanning + policy checks produce public site in one pipeline.
    - example: Public index mirrors internal metadata enabling external reuse & scrutiny.
    - example: Openness metrics (restricted %, review SLAs) reported and drive improvements.
