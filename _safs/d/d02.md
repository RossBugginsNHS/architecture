description: Open by Default
dimension: documentation
tags: [open source,open]
nav_order: 2.72

requirement: |
  Documentation **SHOULD** be published "open by default" and exceptions handled according to policy i.e. sensitivity etc.

  Intent:
    Maximise reuse, scrutiny and collaboration by publishing architecture
    artefacts openly unless a clearly defined sensitivity (personal data,
    security posture, commercial) justifies restriction.

  Open-by-default decision flow:
    1. Classify content: public / internal only / restricted
    2. If not public, record rationale & expiry / review date
    3. Provide a redacted public-friendly variant if feasible
    4. Index still lists restricted artefacts showing meta (title, owner)

  Benefits:
    - Reduces duplicationâ€”other teams discover prior solutions & patterns
    - Encourages earlier peer review and challenge
    - Builds trust through transparency of rationale & constraints

  Required controls:
    - Sensitivity labelling (e.g. banner or front matter classification)
    - Access control aligned to corporate policy & least privilege
    - Redaction pipeline (removes secrets, credentials, explicit IP ranges)
    - Review cadence ensuring restricted classification remains justified

  Evidence examples:
    - Classification register mapping each doc to a sensitivity level
    - Redacted and full versions stored side-by-side with hash / version
    - Access logs or permission matrix for restricted spaces

  Pitfalls:
    - Over-classification through precaution (defaulting to private)
    - Publishing diagrams without pruning sensitive node attributes
    - Divergence between public & internal versions (no sync workflow)

examples: 
    - title: Classification Register Entry
      content: |
        Table row: (Doc ID, Title, Classification, Rationale, Review Date, Owner)
        showing evidence of time-bounded restriction.
    - title: Redacted Architecture Overview
      content: |
        Public version removing specific IPs / credentials while preserving
        component relationships and data flows.
    - title: Access Permission Matrix
      content: |
        YAML / table defining groups with read vs write for each documentation area.

technology:
    - title: Confluence with Space Permissions
      content: |
        Implements coarse access control & page-level restrictions.
    - title: GitHub Public / Internal Repos
      content: |
        Open markdown & decision records, issues for transparent discussion.
    - title: Static Site Generator (Jekyll / MkDocs)
      content: |
        Produces a publicly browseable version from markdown sources.
    - title: DLP / Secret Scanning
      content: |
        Automated detection prevents leaking credentials when opening content.
