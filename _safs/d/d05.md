nav_order: 2.75

requirement: |
    Relevant Archimate models, layer diagrams and supporting solution metadata **MUST** be created and approved by the EA team 

more_info: |
  Purpose:
    Provide consistent semantic modelling of the solution landscape enabling
    analysis (impact, dependency, reuse opportunity) and communication across
    stakeholder groups.

  Required model qualities:
    - Scope appropriate (avoid over-modelling transient detail)
    - Layer alignment (Business / Application / Technology separation)
    - Consistent naming conventions (verbs for processes, nouns for objects)
    - Traceability to capabilities, requirements, decisions
    - Metadata completeness (owner, last_verified, status)

  Modelling approach:
    - Start with capability to application mapping for scope clarity
    - Identify critical flows (value stream or end-to-end journeys)
    - Add interfaces / contracts before internal component expansion
    - Annotate with non-functional hotspots (latency, resilience, data sensitivity)
    - Iterate—avoid big upfront exhaustive modelling

  Approval expectations:
    - Peer review for notation correctness & semantic clarity
    - EA / governance review for strategic alignment & duplication checks
    - Recorded sign-off (date, approver) stored with model commit / file

  Evidence artefacts:
    - Model repository commit referencing issue / decision
    - Mapping table: Capability -> Application / Service
    - Dependency graph export (for impact assessment)

  Pitfalls:
    - Treating Archimate as a drawing tool (ignoring semantic constraints)
    - Obscure element naming requiring tribal knowledge
    - Model sprawl with obsolete views never retired

examples: 
    - title: Capability to Application Mapping View
      content: |
        Diagram highlighting which applications realise each top-10 priority capability.
    - title: End-to-End Critical Flow View
      content: |
        Focused view: user action -> services -> data stores with latency annotations.
    - title: Dependency Hotspot Extract
      content: |
        Graph export listing components with highest inbound dependency count.

technology:
    - title: Archi / ArchiMate Modelling Tool
      content: |
        Primary tool for creating and validating Archimate compliant models.
    - title: Model Repository Plugin (e.g. Git + Archi plugin)
      content: |
        Enables version control and diff of model files.
    - title: Structurizr / C4 (Complementary)
      content: |
        Alternate views for developer comprehension (logical/container).
    - title: Graph Analysis Tool
      content: |
        Processes exported model to compute dependency metrics.

assessment_guidance: |
  How to assess:
    1. List the set of model views. Ensure each has a stated purpose & audience (avoid ornamental diagrams).
    2. Validate semantic correctness: element & relationship types used consistently; no “diagram as decoration”.
    3. Trace sample element → capability → decision (e.g. application component to ADR). Missing linkage indicates modelling silo.
    4. Check currency: spot random 3 elements—do they still exist / are names current in code / repo manifests?
    5. Confirm version control: models diffable (file‑based) & peer reviewed.

  Evidence:
    - Model repository tree (showing logical grouping).
    - View purpose catalogue (table: View | Audience | Decision Support).
    - Diff example from recent change.
    - Capability ↔ Application mapping extract.

  Common issues:
    - Overloaded view mixing conceptual & infrastructure layers.
    - Redundant near-duplicate diagrams offering no additional insight.
    - Model divergence from implemented service boundaries.

  Maturity indicators:
    - Automated export / validation (naming, layering rules).
    - Impact analysis possible (dependency graph script).
    - Decomposition rationale captured in ADRs referencing model IDs.

  Quick wins:
    - Introduce a MODEL_INDEX.md summarising each view.
    - Add a linter script for forbidden relationship combinations.
    - Replace static screenshots with generated SVG exports.

assessment_examples:
  '0': |
      - No formal models; only narrative descriptions or informal sketches.
      - Diagrams exist solely as outdated slide images.
      - Inconsistent naming; stakeholders disagree on component boundaries.
    Impossible to rely on for design / impact analysis.
      - A few reference diagrams exist but lack stated purpose or audience.
      - Mixing conceptual, logical, infrastructure details in one view.
      - Significant divergence from implemented system.
    Limited value; often ignored.
  '2': |
      - Basic set of context / container diagrams maintained.
      - Some element naming standard emerging; relationships ad-hoc.
      - No systematic linkage to decisions / capabilities.
      - Update lag noticeable (> quarter) for several models.
    Provides partial orientation only.
      - Defined view catalogue with purpose statements for most views.
      - Majority of diagrams reflect current state; a few stale legacy views flagged.
      - Some cross-linking (decisions, capabilities) manually curated.
      - Modelling standards documented; partial adherence.
    Useful for impact scoping; needs consistency & automation uplift.
  '4': |
      - Comprehensive view set aligned to stakeholder concerns.
      - >85% diagrams as code with enforced naming & layering rules.
      - Change to model triggers ADR or update note automatically.
      - Capability & decision trace embedded in model metadata.
      - Automated validation catches forbidden relationships / orphan elements.
    Minor backlog of low-value legacy views pending retirement.
      - Model repository fully integrated: diff visualisations in PRs, impact analysis scripts.
      - 100% diagram-as-code; generation pipeline produces consistent exports.
      - Live dependency graph used for risk, cost & change simulation.
      - Tight coupling between ADR updates, capability evolution & model IDs.
      - Continuous linting metrics (naming, layering violations) near zero.
    Models actively drive decision-making & governance.
