requirement: |
    Relevant Archimate models, layer diagrams and supporting solution metadata **MUST** be created and approved by the EA team

  Purpose:
    Provide consistent semantic modelling of the solution landscape enabling
    analysis (impact, dependency, reuse opportunity) and communication across
    stakeholder groups.

  Required model qualities:
    - Scope appropriate (avoid over-modelling transient detail)
    - Layer alignment (Business / Application / Technology separation)
    - Consistent naming conventions (verbs for processes, nouns for objects)
    - Traceability to capabilities, requirements, decisions
    - Metadata completeness (owner, last_verified, status)

  Modelling approach:
    - Start with capability to application mapping for scope clarity
    - Identify critical flows (value stream or end-to-end journeys)
    - Add interfaces / contracts before internal component expansion
    - Annotate with non-functional hotspots (latency, resilience, data sensitivity)
    - Iterate—avoid big upfront exhaustive modelling

  Approval expectations:
    - Peer review for notation correctness & semantic clarity
    - EA / governance review for strategic alignment & duplication checks
    - Recorded sign-off (date, approver) stored with model commit / file

  Evidence artefacts:
    - Model repository commit referencing issue / decision
    - Mapping table: Capability -> Application / Service
    - Dependency graph export (for impact assessment)

  Pitfalls:
    - Treating Archimate as a drawing tool (ignoring semantic constraints)
    - Obscure element naming requiring tribal knowledge
    - Model sprawl with obsolete views never retired

examples: 
    - title: Capability to Application Mapping View
      content: |
        Diagram highlighting which applications realise each top-10 priority capability.
    - title: End-to-End Critical Flow View
      content: |
        Focused view: user action -> services -> data stores with latency annotations.
    - title: Dependency Hotspot Extract
      content: |
        Graph export listing components with highest inbound dependency count.

technology:
    - title: Archi / ArchiMate Modelling Tool
      content: |
        Primary tool for creating and validating Archimate compliant models.
    - title: Model Repository Plugin (e.g. Git + Archi plugin)
      content: |
        Enables version control and diff of model files.
    - title: Structurizr / C4 (Complementary)
      content: |
        Alternate views for developer comprehension (logical/container).
    - title: Graph Analysis Tool
      content: |
        Processes exported model to compute dependency metrics.

assessment_guidance: |
  How to assess:
    1. List the set of model views. Ensure each has a stated purpose & audience (avoid ornamental diagrams).
    2. Validate semantic correctness: element & relationship types used consistently; no “diagram as decoration”.
    3. Trace sample element → capability → decision (e.g. application component to ADR). Missing linkage indicates modelling silo.
    4. Check currency: spot random 3 elements—do they still exist / are names current in code / repo manifests?
    5. Confirm version control: models diffable (file‑based) & peer reviewed.

  Evidence:
    - Model repository tree (showing logical grouping).
    - View purpose catalogue (table: View | Audience | Decision Support).
    - Diff example from recent change.
    - Capability ↔ Application mapping extract.

  Common issues:
    - Overloaded view mixing conceptual & infrastructure layers.
    - Redundant near-duplicate diagrams offering no additional insight.
    - Model divergence from implemented service boundaries.

  Maturity indicators:
    - Automated export / validation (naming, layering rules).
    - Impact analysis possible (dependency graph script).
    - Decomposition rationale captured in ADRs referencing model IDs.

  Quick wins:
    - Introduce a MODEL_INDEX.md summarising each view.
    - Add a linter script for forbidden relationship combinations.
    - Replace static screenshots with generated SVG exports.
    
assessment_examples:
  '0':
    - example: No structured models; architecture conveyed only through ad‑hoc slides.
    - example: Inability to trace components to capabilities or decisions.
  '1':
    - example: Some diagrams exist but mix abstraction layers & lack purpose statements.
    - example: Models stored as binaries; diffs / reviews ineffective.
  '2':
    - example: Initial capability map & logical overview; gaps in critical flows & interfaces.
    - example: Partial naming conventions; limited ADR references.
  '3':
    - example: Curated set of version-controlled views; purposes & audiences defined.
    - example: Capability ↔ Application mapping mostly complete; traceability emerging.
  '4':
    - example: Linter / checklist enforces semantic rules; dependency metrics generated automatically.
    - example: Generated artefact renders (SVG/PNG) auto-refreshed on change.
  '5':
    - example: Continuous validation pipeline (naming, layering, forbidden relations) gating merges.
    - example: Full traceability (capability → element → decision) derivable programmatically.
    - example: Model metrics (dependency hotspots, churn) inform planning & risk reviews.
