requirement: |
  The architecture documentation **SHOULD** be appropriate in scope and quality for the solution covering (but not exclusively) as defined in D06.

  Aim:
    Define the minimal yet sufficient set of artefacts providing a coherent,
    navigable representation of the solution—balancing thoroughness with
    maintainability.

  Coverage principles:
    - Intent before detail (vision & goals anchor subsequent design)
    - Decisions nearest to their impact (collocated ADR & affected diagram)
    - Non-functional concerns integrated, not an afterthought appendix
    - Traceability chain: Capability -> Requirement -> Design Element -> Decision
    - Automate generation where possible (diagrams-as-code, API specs)

  Prioritisation heuristic:
    1. Is the artefact required for governance approval or risk mitigation?
    2. Does it materially aid downstream engineering or operations?
    3. Is there an existing artefact fulfilling this need already?
    4. Can it be generated from source / model to avoid drift?

  Maintaining scope:
    - Use a catalogue table enumerating each artefact, purpose, owner, cadence
    - Explicitly list intentionally omitted artefacts with rationale (prevents rework)
    - Flag experimental / provisional sections separately

  Evidence examples:
    - Coverage matrix mapping artefacts to stakeholder concerns & principles
    - Generated site index linking to every required artefact with status badge
    - Automated completeness report (missing / stale items)

  Pitfalls:
    - Producing every possible artefact template irrespective of value
    - Duplicating similar diagrams at multiple abstraction levels with drift
    - Parking decisions only in meeting minutes (losing searchable context)

examples: 
    - title: Coverage Matrix Table
      content: |
        Rows: Artefact type; Columns: Purpose, Owner, Review Cadence, Status, Link.
    - title: Completeness Report
      content: |
        Script output enumerating missing or overdue artefacts with severity.
    - title: Traceability Chain Extract
      content: |
        YAML snippet linking capability IDs to design components and related ADR IDs.

technology:
    - title: Static Site Generator
      content: |
        Index & status badges for artefact catalogue.
    - title: Diagram-as-Code (PlantUML / Mermaid)
      content: |
        Enables regeneration & drift detection.
    - title: API Definition Tooling (OpenAPI / AsyncAPI)
      content: |
        Canonical interface specifications reduce duplication.
    - title: Scripted Completeness Auditor
      content: |
        Scans repository ensuring required artefacts present & dated.

assessment_guidance: |
  How to assess:
    1. Derive a catalogue (script or manual) of required artefacts vs present ones.
    2. Categorise each: Present & Current / Present but Stale / Missing (Justified / Unjustified).
    3. Evaluate traceability chain for one feature: Capability → Requirement / Objective → Design element → ADR → NFR → Operational metric.
    4. Identify intentional omissions with explicit rationale. Lack of rationale = gap.
    5. Review proportion of auto-generated vs manually maintained artefacts (seek automation opportunities for high-churn items).

  Evidence:
    - Coverage matrix (artefact, status, owner, cadence, gap_action).
    - Traceability example row.
    - Rationale list for omitted artefacts.
    - Automation inventory (what is generated & how).

  Common gaps:
    - “Parking lot” of TODO sections never resolved.
    - Orphan artefacts (no index reference / owner).
    - Excessive duplication (multiple overlapping diagrams or specs).

  Maturity signals:
    - Coverage >90% critical artefacts (with justified omissions documented).
    - Automated completeness report executed on CI or schedule.
    - Clear removal / archival workflow (no silent deletion).

  Quick wins:
    - Generate a machine-readable inventory (YAML) & validate on pipeline.
    - Add owner & review cadence fields if absent.
    - Combine / retire duplicate diagrams with little unique information.
    
assessment_examples:
  '0':
    - example: No artefact catalogue; key items missing & untracked.
    - example: Duplicate conflicting diagrams coexist; no rationale captured.
  '1':
    - example: Partial checklist; several mandatory artefacts absent without justification.
    - example: Traceability chain (capability → decision) frequently broken.
  '2':
    - example: Draft coverage matrix; intentional omissions not yet recorded; coverage ~60–70%.
    - example: Some artefacts missing owner or cadence fields.
  '3':
    - example: Maintained catalogue with rationale for omissions; traceability sample mostly succeeds.
    - example: Script identifies missing / stale artefacts but not enforced.
  '4':
    - example: ">85–90% coverage of required artefacts; omissions justified & time-boxed."
    - example: Scheduled completeness script raises issues automatically.
  '5':
    - example: ">95% critical coverage sustained; CI gate blocks missing / stale mandatory artefacts."
    - example: Inventory drives dashboards (coverage %, gap ageing trends) & improvement actions.
    - example: Traceability export (capability → design → ADR → NFR) produced on demand for audits.
