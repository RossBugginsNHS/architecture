description: Documentation Coverage

nav_order: 2.76

requirement: |
  The architecture documentation **SHOULD** be appropriate in scope and quality for the solution covering (but not exclusively) as defined in D06.

  Aim:
    Define the minimal yet sufficient set of artefacts providing a coherent,
    navigable representation of the solutionâ€”balancing thoroughness with
    maintainability.

  Coverage principles:
    - Intent before detail (vision & goals anchor subsequent design)
    - Decisions nearest to their impact (collocated ADR & affected diagram)
    - Non-functional concerns integrated, not an afterthought appendix
    - Traceability chain: Capability -> Requirement -> Design Element -> Decision
    - Automate generation where possible (diagrams-as-code, API specs)

  Prioritisation heuristic:
    1. Is the artefact required for governance approval or risk mitigation?
    2. Does it materially aid downstream engineering or operations?
    3. Is there an existing artefact fulfilling this need already?
    4. Can it be generated from source / model to avoid drift?

  Maintaining scope:
    - Use a catalogue table enumerating each artefact, purpose, owner, cadence
    - Explicitly list intentionally omitted artefacts with rationale (prevents rework)
    - Flag experimental / provisional sections separately

  Evidence examples:
    - Coverage matrix mapping artefacts to stakeholder concerns & principles
    - Generated site index linking to every required artefact with status badge
    - Automated completeness report (missing / stale items)

  Pitfalls:
    - Producing every possible artefact template irrespective of value
    - Duplicating similar diagrams at multiple abstraction levels with drift
    - Parking decisions only in meeting minutes (losing searchable context)

examples: 
    - title: Coverage Matrix Table
      content: |
        Rows: Artefact type; Columns: Purpose, Owner, Review Cadence, Status, Link.
    - title: Completeness Report
      content: |
        Script output enumerating missing or overdue artefacts with severity.
    - title: Traceability Chain Extract
      content: |
        YAML snippet linking capability IDs to design components and related ADR IDs.

technology:
    - title: Static Site Generator
      content: |
        Index & status badges for artefact catalogue.
    - title: Diagram-as-Code (PlantUML / Mermaid)
      content: |
        Enables regeneration & drift detection.
    - title: API Definition Tooling (OpenAPI / AsyncAPI)
      content: |
        Canonical interface specifications reduce duplication.
    - title: Scripted Completeness Auditor
      content: |
        Scans repository ensuring required artefacts present & dated.
