requirement: |
  All architecture documentation **SHOULD** be maintained (with supporting processes and change control) within the appropriate NHS England knowledge store(s) e.g. Aalto, SharePoint, Confluence.

  Purpose:
    Architecture information must be easy to find, trusted, and governed. A single
    authoritative location (with clearly sign‑posted exceptions) reduces time lost
    hunting for diagrams, decisions and models and lowers the risk of teams
    operating from stale copies.

  Scope of "architecture documentation":
    - Direction (vision, principles, roadmap)
    - Designs (context, logical / physical views, data, integration)
    - Decisions (ADR / KAD / debt register)
    - Non‑functional & risk material (NFRs, threat / resilience aspects)

  Store selection guidelines:
    - One canonical store per document type (e.g. ADR index in Git, models in Archi repo)
    - Discoverable via an index / landing page
    - Supports version history & access control (read for all, write restricted)
    - Supports export / retention policies

  Governance & lifecycle:
    - Every artefact has an owner (role not person) and a review cadence
    - Arch debt & retired components are marked clearly (do not delete context)
    - Change control references issue / PR / ticket IDs
    - Links to related artefacts maintained (e.g. decision -> impacted diagram)

  Evidence you can supply:
    - Repository / space index page enumerating doc types and locations
    - ADR index with stable IDs and dates
    - Access model (who can contribute / approve)

  Common pitfalls:
    - Splitting canonical docs across Confluence + SharePoint + local folders
    - Hosting diagrams only inside presentation decks (losing diff history)
    - Personal OneDrive / desktop copies treated as source

  Quality checklist heuristic:
    - Findability: < 2 clicks from landing page
    - Freshness: Last review within agreed cadence (e.g. 90 days)
    - Traceability: Each design links to at least one decision & principle

examples: 
    - title: Canonical Architecture Index Page
      content: |
        A README (or Confluence landing page) listing each artefact type, the
        canonical location, owner role, and review frequency.
    - title: Decision Log Extract
      content: |
        Table of ADR IDs with status (accepted / superseded) and links to the
        corresponding solution diagrams illustrating the impact.
    - title: Repository Structure Screenshot
      content: |
        Example Git tree showing /docs (markdown), /decisions (ADRs), /models
        (Archi) and /diagrams (plantuml) enforcing predictable layout.

technology:
    - title: Confluence / SharePoint
      content: |
        Corporate knowledge stores for wider audience consumption & governance packs.
    - title: Git / GitHub Enterprise
      content: |
        Docs‑as‑Code (markdown, ADRs, version control, code review workflow).
    - title: Aalto (or Architecture Registry)
      content: |
        Catalogue / inventory of solutions & higher level artefacts.
    - title: Backstage / Developer Portal (optional)
      content: |
        Surfacing architecture metadata and linking operational docs.
    - title: PlantUML / Structurizr / Mermaid
      content: |
        Diagram as code enabling diffable, reviewable design artefacts.

  How to assess (Solution Architect focus):
    1. Locate the single authoritative landing page / index for architecture docs.
       Confirm it enumerates ALL required artefact types (vision, decisions, models etc.) or states why absent.
    2. Pick a recent significant change (e.g. new component). Trace: index → design doc → ADR → relevant diagram commit. If any hop fails, note gap.
    3. Sample 3 ADRs. Check rationale clarity, linkage to impacted artefacts and status accuracy.
    4. Inspect freshness: at least one artefact each from strategy, design, decision & risk should show a last_verified date within agreed cadence.
    5. Verify permissions: broad read access, controlled write (no personal silos). Spot-check for shadow copies (old Confluence space / slide deck).

  Evidence to gather:
    - Screenshot / snippet of documentation index.
    - Traceability chain example (list the linked URIs).
    - ADR sample IDs with last modified + status.
    - Freshness metadata table (artefact, last_verified, next_review_due).
    - Access / repo permission matrix.

  Questions to ask:
    - What prevents divergence / local copies forming today?
    - Who owns keeping the index current? Is that a role, not a person?
    - How is retirement / archival of obsolete docs handled?
    - Are diagrams stored as code or binary-only? (Diff & review implications.)

  Common anti‑patterns:
    - Multiple wikis claiming to be canonical.
    - Diagrams only embedded in presentations (no source of truth).
    - ADRs missing alternatives / consequences.
    - Decision rationale living solely in meeting minutes.

  Maturity indicators:
    - All artefacts link back to index (no orphan markdown).
    - Automated check (script / pipeline) validating presence & metadata.
    - >90% artefacts within freshness SLA.
    - Clear ownership roster (role-based) for each artefact class.

  Quick win recommendations (if weak):
    - Create a docs/README.md index with a simple table (Type | Location | Owner | Review cadence).
    - Introduce last_verified front matter & a weekly script to flag overdue.
    - Convert static diagrams to diagram-as-code for diffable change history.
    - Add an ADR template & pre-commit hook to enforce required sections.
