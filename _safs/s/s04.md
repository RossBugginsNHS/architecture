description: Objectives

requirement: |
  The solution design **SHOULD** be able to meet the stated user needs and overall business objectives/drivers.

todos:
  - what are examples of what those needs look like
  - how to critique those needs
  - where to find the current overall business drivers?

  Intent:
    Demonstrate clear alignment between articulated user needs, business
    objectives and architectural design choices.

  Needs & objectives linkage:
    - User need -> Capability -> Feature / Epic -> Architectural Component
    - Each objective has measurable success metric & baseline
    - Architectural decisions reference objective impact (positive / trade-off)

  Critique checklist:
    - Is the need phrased from user perspective (not internal system desire)?
    - Does objective have time-bound target & metric?
    - Are conflicting objectives (speed vs cost) explicitly balanced?
    - Is there traceable evidence of user research / data?

  Evidence artefacts:
    - Objective to capability trace matrix
    - Decision records annotating objective influence
    - Metrics dashboard showing progress towards targets

  Pitfalls:
    - Listing vague aspirations ("improve experience") without metric
    - Retrofitting objectives after design locked
    - Ignoring negative impact or opportunity cost of choices

    - title: Dashboard Metric Tile
      content: |
        Shows progress: mean onboarding time 25% reduced vs 30% target.
