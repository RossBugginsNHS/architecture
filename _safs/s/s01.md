more_info: |
  The Executive Design Authority (EDA) ensures strategic alignment of solutions. Provide explicit references to approved strategies (e.g. TD Design Authority, P&P DA) in architecture documents and record approvals.

  Minimum evidence:
  - Strategy alignment section in Solution Architecture Overview
  - Minutes or approval record from relevant design authority
  - Named accountable senior architect / authority contact

examples:
  - title: Alignment Pack Excerpt
    content: |
      "Section 2.1 Strategic Alignment: This solution implements capabilities 4.2 and 7.1 from the TD Strategy and was endorsed by P&P DA on 12 Sep 2025 (Ref: DA-2025-0912)."

    content: Holds executive strategies and controlled versions.

  Assessment focus:
    Validate demonstrable, current alignment to approved executive strategies with traceable endorsement and challenge history.

  Steps:
    1. Locate strategy alignment section in core architecture doc: confirm explicit references (IDs / version dates) to each governing strategy.
    2. Retrieve latest design authority minutes / decision log: verify this solution appears with outcome (approved / conditional) & date.
    3. Inspect any conditional approvals: check condition actions exist & status (no orphan conditions).
    4. Pick 2 significant architecture decisions; confirm each notes strategic objective or principle linkage not just implicitly assumed.
    5. Review change since last authority engagement: are material deltas (scope, tech pivot) re-presented or at least notified?

  Evidence:
    - Excerpt of alignment section (with strategy references)
    - Authority decision entry (ID, outcome, date, conditions)
    - Condition tracking item(s)
    - Decision record linking strategy objective

  Red flags:
    - Generic wording (“aligned to NHS strategy”) without concrete identifiers
    - Approval older than threshold (e.g. > 9 months) with substantial solution evolution
    - Conditions marked done but no artefact update PR link
    - Strategy changes unreflected in design choices

  Maturity signals:
    - Automated diff highlighting strategy updates that may impact solution
    - Authority outcomes machine-readable & cross-linked to ADRs
    - Alignment coverage metrics (objectives mapped vs total relevant)

  Quick improvements:
    - Add table: Strategy Element | Related Capability | Supporting Decision | Evidence Link
    - Implement linter requiring versioned strategy references
    - Track condition closure via tagged pull requests
