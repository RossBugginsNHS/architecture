description: Roadmap

requirement: |
  A well-formed and maintained product vision and roadmap **SHOULD** exist with appropriate detail around architecture elements.

todos:
  - examples of good and bad product visions
  - who should you be working with
  - who should own those documents (vision and roadmap)
  - what is the appropriate level of detail?

  Goal:
    Maintain a living product vision & roadmap that communicates strategic
    intent, sequencing logic and architectural evolution path.

  Vision qualities:
    - Problem & outcome framed (not solution-first)
    - Aligned to measurable objectives (OKRs / KPIs)
    - Differentiators vs capability gap clearly stated

  Roadmap structuring:
    - Outcome-based increments (value slices) rather than component lists
    - Architecture runway tasks aligned to upcoming capability needs
    - Dependency visualisation (avoid hidden critical path)
    - Revisit cadence (at least quarterly) with evidence-based adjustments

  Pitfalls:
    - Slide deck drift (source-of-truth mismatch)
    - Date-driven commitments surviving after major assumption changes
    - Feature factory lists detached from objectives

        "Enable secure, timely patient notification across all channels with
        measurable engagement insights."

assessment_guidance: |
  Assessment focus:
    Validate the roadmap expresses outcome-driven sequencing, architectural runway alignment and remains a living artefact.

  Steps:
    1. Review vision statement: ensure problem/outcome framing & measurable ambition; note any solution bias creeping in.
    2. Examine current & next two increments: verify each has outcome metric (baseline + target) not just feature list.
    3. Trace 2 upcoming features to required architecture runway items (scaling, resilience, data model evolution) present in backlog.
    4. Look at last revision history: identify actual change decisions (re-prioritisation) vs cosmetic date shifts.
    5. Assess dependency visualisation: any hidden critical path not represented?

  Evidence:
    - Vision excerpt with metric link
    - Increment slice (Outcome → Epics → Metric)
    - Runway backlog ticket referencing future outcome
    - Changelog diff (before vs after revision)

  Red flags:
    - Feature factory style rows (verbs like “Add”, “Implement” without outcome)
    - Stale roadmap (no commits / updates within SLA period)
    - Architecture runway appears only reactive (after incidents)
    - Hard dates retained despite assumption invalidation

  Maturity signals:
    - Versioned roadmap file diffable in repo
    - Outcome metric dashboards embedded or linked per increment
    - Scenario planning or alternative paths documented for uncertainty areas

  Quick improvements:
    - Introduce per-increment outcome metrics table
    - Add ‘Assumptions & Validation Plan’ section for each major theme
    - Automate stale roadmap warning (no change in X weeks)

assessment_examples:
  "0":
    - example: No written vision; roadmap is a static feature list deck not updated for >6 months.
    - example: Architecture runway tasks absent; scaling work appears only after incidents.
  "1":
    - example: Vision statement exists but solution-focused (“build X platform”) and lacks measurable outcomes.
    - example: Roadmap increments list features without baseline or target metrics.
  "2":
    - example: Outcome wording present for near-term increment; some metrics defined but baselines missing.
    - example: Initial runway items captured yet not explicitly linked back to increments.
  "3":
    - example: All active increments show Outcome → Epics → Metric with baseline & target; quarterly revision log maintained.
    - example: Runway backlog traces to future increment dependencies (scaling, resilience) before need date.
  "4":
    - example: Roadmap versioned in repo; automated diff summarises scope shifts & metric adjustments.
    - example: Scenario variants (optimistic, constrained) documented with decision triggers.
  "5":
    - example: Metrics dashboard auto-pulls roadmap increment definitions; stale increment alerts generated when no metric progress.
    - example: Capacity & risk models continuously feed roadmap re-prioritisation (data-driven adjustments recorded).
