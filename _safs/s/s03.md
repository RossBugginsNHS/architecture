description: Roadmap

requirement: |
  A well-formed and maintained product vision and roadmap **SHOULD** exist with appropriate detail around architecture elements.

todos:
  - examples of good and bad product visions
  - who should you be working with
  - who should own those documents (vision and roadmap)
  - what is the appropriate level of detail?

  Goal:
    Maintain a living product vision & roadmap that communicates strategic
    intent, sequencing logic and architectural evolution path.

  Vision qualities:
    - Problem & outcome framed (not solution-first)
    - Aligned to measurable objectives (OKRs / KPIs)
    - Differentiators vs capability gap clearly stated

  Roadmap structuring:
    - Outcome-based increments (value slices) rather than component lists
    - Architecture runway tasks aligned to upcoming capability needs
    - Dependency visualisation (avoid hidden critical path)
    - Revisit cadence (at least quarterly) with evidence-based adjustments

  Pitfalls:
    - Slide deck drift (source-of-truth mismatch)
    - Date-driven commitments surviving after major assumption changes
    - Feature factory lists detached from objectives
