description: Business Capability Model

requirement: |
  We **SHOULD** be able to demonstrate which capabilities from the NHSE Business Capability Model the solution is realising, and any potential duplication identified.

  Intent:
    Demonstrate explicit linkage between solution scope and enterprise business
    capabilities; surface duplication & fragmentation risks early.

  Capability mapping steps:
    1. Identify capabilities the solution realises / enhances
    2. Classify support level: Primary, Partial, Consuming
    3. Highlight overlaps with existing systems (candidate consolidation)
    4. Trace each capability to roadmap epics & metrics
    5. Record rationale for introducing any new capability constructs

  Analysis heuristics:
    - Overlap count >1 for primary capability -> investigate consolidation
    - Capability with no owner or metric -> clarify accountability
    - Orphan capability (implemented but not in model) -> update model or retire

  Pitfalls:
    - Treating capability list as feature backlog
    - Mapping at inconsistent granularity (apples vs oranges)
    - No update cycle after capability model evolves

assessment_guidance: |
  Assessment focus:
    Determine clarity, completeness, and actionability of capability mapping plus proactive identification of duplication / fragmentation.

  Steps:
    1. Extract capability mapping artefact: confirm support level classification (Primary/Partial/Consuming) and ownership fields populated.
    2. Cross-check 2 mapped capabilities against enterprise catalogue canonical names & versions.
    3. Identify any duplicate implementations (same capability across >=2 systems): verify consolidation analysis or rationale to retain.
    4. Trace one capability to roadmap epics + KPI; confirm measurable outcome exists.
    5. Inspect change log: has mapping been updated after recent scope or model changes?

  Evidence:
    - Mapping table snippet
    - Duplicate capability evaluation note
    - Capability → Epic → Metric trace line
    - Change log / commit diff for mapping update

  Red flags:
    - Capability names diverging from canonical model (drift)
    - Large set of “Partial” with no planned path to Primary owner clarity
    - Duplicates with no consolidation backlog item
    - Newly built capability absent from enterprise model (shadow taxonomy)

  Maturity signals:
    - Visual dependency graph auto-generated from source mapping YAML
    - Consolidation candidate list with prioritised actions & status
    - KPI dashboard referencing capability IDs directly

  Quick improvements:
    - Introduce mapping schema & CI validation
    - Tag duplicates with candidate_consolidation: true & review_date
    - Add lightweight diff script notifying model changes downstream

assessment_examples:
  "0":
    - example: No capability mapping; solution scope described only in feature terms.
    - example: Duplicate capabilities unidentified; overlapping systems proliferate.
  "1":
    - example: Initial list of capabilities captured but lacks support level classification or ownership.
    - example: Duplication suspected but no documented evaluation.
  "2":
    - example: Mapping includes support levels; some overlaps noted without consolidation plan.
    - example: Capability names partially misaligned with enterprise catalogue.
  "3":
    - example: Full mapping validated against catalogue; duplicates have recorded consolidation analysis & next steps.
    - example: Capability ↔ roadmap ↔ KPI trace exists for primary capabilities.
  "4":
    - example: Automated validation (schema/lint) enforces naming & support level consistency; consolidation backlog progressing.
    - example: Visual dependency graph auto-generated and updated on changes.
  "5":
    - example: Continuous sync with enterprise model (diff alerts) and proactive consolidation proposals accepted.
    - example: KPI dashboard directly keyed by capability IDs driving prioritisation.
