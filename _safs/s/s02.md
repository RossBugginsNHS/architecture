description: Business Capability Model

requirement: |
  We **SHOULD** be able to demonstrate which capabilities from the NHSE Business Capability Model the solution is realising, and any potential duplication identified.

  Intent:
    Demonstrate explicit linkage between solution scope and enterprise business
    capabilities; surface duplication & fragmentation risks early.

  Capability mapping steps:
    1. Identify capabilities the solution realises / enhances
    2. Classify support level: Primary, Partial, Consuming
    3. Highlight overlaps with existing systems (candidate consolidation)
    4. Trace each capability to roadmap epics & metrics
    5. Record rationale for introducing any new capability constructs

  Analysis heuristics:
    - Overlap count >1 for primary capability -> investigate consolidation
    - Capability with no owner or metric -> clarify accountability
    - Orphan capability (implemented but not in model) -> update model or retire

  Pitfalls:
    - Treating capability list as feature backlog
    - Mapping at inconsistent granularity (apples vs oranges)
    - No update cycle after capability model evolves
