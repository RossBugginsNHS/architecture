requirement: |
  All Architecture decisions **SHOULD** be documented with a lightweight Architecture Decision Record with options and clear rationale. E.g. SEQF Any Decision Record Template (GitHub)

more_info: |
  Goal:
    Capture significant decisions succinctly so future maintainers understand
    why current architecture exists and when to revisit it.

  ADR essentials:
    - Context (problem and forces)
    - Decision (what) & Status (proposed / accepted / superseded)
    - Options considered (+ trade-offs)
    - Consequences (positive & negative, follow-up actions)
    - Linked artefacts (diagrams, principles, risks, debt)

  Good practice:
    - One decision per record (avoid mega-ADRs)
    - Time-stamp & stable identifier
    - Keep superseded ADRs (historical chain)
    - Use templates & automation (pre-populate metadata)

  Review triggers:
    - Related principle or policy changes
    - Performance / cost anomalies contradict assumptions
    - Introduction of major new capabilities / platforms

  Pitfalls:
    - Writing ADRs post-hoc (loses deliberation detail)
    - Omitting alternatives section
    - Duplicating low-impact implementation choices (noise)

examples: 
    - title: Accepted ADR Example
      content: |
        ADR-042: Adopt Event-Driven Integration using Kafka. Context, Decision,
        Alternatives (REST Polling, Batch ETL), Consequences, Status: Accepted.
    - title: Superseded ADR Chain
      content: |
        ADR-018 superseded by ADR-033 with rationale & migration notes.
    - title: Lightweight Template
      content: |
        Markdown skeleton with headings & guidance comments.

technology:
    - title: ADR Static Site / Index Generator
      content: |
        Builds searchable list of decisions & statuses.
    - title: Repository Hooks / Linter
      content: |
        Ensures mandatory ADR sections present.
    - title: Diagram Links (PlantUML / Mermaid)
      content: |
        Embeds visual context or references canonical diagrams.

assessment_guidance: |
  Assessment focus:
    Verify decision coverage, ADR quality and lifecycle hygiene (proposed → accepted → superseded) supporting architectural traceability.

  Steps:
    1. Inventory ADRs: compute ratio of accepted vs superseded vs proposed; look for abandoned proposals.
    2. Sample 5 ADRs (mix of statuses): assess presence of context, options, consequences & links; note any template drift.
    3. Cross-check 2 recent significant architectural changes: confirm an ADR exists or rationale documented why not.
    4. Follow one supersession chain: ensure continuity of rationale & migration actions.
    5. Verify automation: linter / generator ensuring mandatory sections present.

  Evidence:
    - ADR index statistics
    - Quality review notes per sampled ADR
    - Supersession chain diagram / list
    - Linter output log

  Red flags:
    - Bulk creation of ADRs post-hoc (commit clustering)
    - Missing alternatives sections (“None” without justification)
    - Decisions embedded only in slide decks

  Maturity signals:
    - ADR updates triggered by metric thresholds (e.g. scale, cost changes)
    - Searchable tags enabling thematic analysis (security, data, resilience)
    - Continuous publishing (site / index) updated on merge

  Quick improvements:
    - Add a PR check rejecting ADRs without alternatives & consequences
    - Introduce ADR changelog summarising weekly additions / supersessions
    - Tag ADRs with related debt / risk IDs for holistic impact view

assessment_examples:
  '0':
    - example: No ADRs; rationale buried in slide decks or chat threads.
    - example: Decisions rediscovered / re-litigated due to lack of history.
  '1':
    - example: A few ADRs created post-hoc; missing alternatives & consequences sections.
    - example: Superseded decisions overwritten; chain not preserved.
  '2':
    - example: Template adopted; majority new significant decisions have ADRs; some lack thorough alternative analysis.
    - example: Partial supersession tracking; index manually maintained.
  '3':
    - example: ADR index complete with statuses; supersession chains preserved; linter ensures mandatory sections.
    - example: Traceability links (diagrams, risks, debt) for most ADRs.
  '4':
    - example: Automation updates ADR site/index on merge; tagging supports thematic queries.
    - example: Review triggers (metrics / policy changes) recorded; historical accuracy audited.
  '5':
    - example: Decision intelligence metrics (lead time, reversal rate) tracked & improving.
    - example: ADR lifecycle integrated with governance dashboards; proactive revisit triggers executed.
    - example: 100% significant architectural decisions represented with high-quality ADR chains.
