description: Architectural Governance

requirement: |
  The overall approach to architecture governance **SHOULD** be appropriate and commensurate with the nature of the solution.

  Purpose:
    Establish a governance approach proportionate to solution risk, complexity
    and strategic impactâ€”avoiding both bureaucracy and unmanaged sprawl.

  Tailoring dimensions:
    - Risk / criticality classification (patient safety, data sensitivity)
    - Organisational dependency count
    - Investment magnitude & lifecycle duration
    - Regulatory / compliance surface area

  Governance building blocks:
    - Principles & policy alignment checklists
    - Design authority decision log
    - Exception register (with review dates & mitigation)
    - Capability & roadmap traceability matrix
    - Continuous assurance (pipeline policy controls, automated checks)

  Maturity indicators:
    - Decisions traceable to artefacts & rationale
    - Exceptions time-bound & monitored
    - Automated conformance scans (e.g. IaC security, API style) integrated
    - Feedback loop from incidents / operations into governance heuristics

  Pitfalls:
    - Copy-pasting heavyweight governance onto low-risk prototypes
    - Treating exception approvals as permanent policy changes
    - Manual checklist churn with no automation uplift over time
