description: Architectural Governance

requirement: |
  The overall approach to architecture governance **SHOULD** be appropriate and commensurate with the nature of the solution.

  Purpose:
    Establish a governance approach proportionate to solution risk, complexity
    and strategic impact—avoiding both bureaucracy and unmanaged sprawl.

  Tailoring dimensions:
    - Risk / criticality classification (patient safety, data sensitivity)
    - Organisational dependency count
    - Investment magnitude & lifecycle duration
    - Regulatory / compliance surface area

  Governance building blocks:
    - Principles & policy alignment checklists
    - Design authority decision log
    - Exception register (with review dates & mitigation)
    - Capability & roadmap traceability matrix
    - Continuous assurance (pipeline policy controls, automated checks)

  Maturity indicators:
    - Decisions traceable to artefacts & rationale
    - Exceptions time-bound & monitored
    - Automated conformance scans (e.g. IaC security, API style) integrated
    - Feedback loop from incidents / operations into governance heuristics

  Pitfalls:
    - Copy-pasting heavyweight governance onto low-risk prototypes
    - Treating exception approvals as permanent policy changes
    - Manual checklist churn with no automation uplift over time

assessment_guidance: |
  Assessment focus:
    Determine if governance is proportionate, automated where repeatable, and actively pruning exceptions.

  Steps:
    1. Review governance tailoring matrix: confirm solution risk tier mapping matches applied controls.
    2. Inspect exception register: sample for review dates & mitigation ownership; calculate % overdue.
    3. Enumerate automated vs manual controls (e.g. IaC policy checks, API lint, dependency scanning); identify automation coverage gaps.
    4. Trace feedback loop: pick a recent incident / audit finding and show governance adjustment.
    5. Evaluate duplication: any parallel forums producing overlapping decisions?

  Evidence:
    - Tailoring matrix extract
    - Exception register metrics (count by status, overdue rate)
    - Pipeline control report screenshot
    - Post-incident governance change log entry

  Red flags:
    - High volume of long-lived exceptions
    - Manual checklist usage for high-frequency validations
    - Governance artefacts not adjusted after major incidents

  Maturity signals:
    - Continuous compliance reports generated automatically per build
    - Exception half-life trending downward
    - Clear RACI for each control owner & review cadence

  Quick improvements:
    - Automate top 2 manual checks via policy-as-code
    - Introduce exception ageing dashboard
    - Schedule quarterly governance pruning workshop

assessment_examples:
  '0':
    - example: No articulated governance model; ad‑hoc decisions; exceptions not recorded.
    - example: Manual checklists (if any) inconsistently applied.
  '1':
    - example: Basic governance forum exists; decisions logged but exceptions unmanaged (no review dates).
    - example: Minimal automation; reliance on manual validation.
  '2':
    - example: Tailoring matrix drafted; some exceptions have mitigation & review dates; automation pilots started.
    - example: Overdue exception reviews >25%.
  '3':
    - example: Proportionate controls applied by risk tier; majority exceptions time-bound & tracked.
    - example: Initial policy-as-code checks integrated (e.g. lint, basic IaC rules).
  '4':
    - example: Comprehensive automation coverage (IaC, API style, dependency scanning) with regular reporting.
    - example: Exception half-life decreasing; overdue reviews <10%.
  '5':
    - example: Governance model continuously tuned via metrics (exception ageing, automation efficacy).
    - example: Near-real-time compliance dashboards; manual reviews focus only on novel / complex changes.
    - example: Exceptions auto-expire without renewal; portfolio trend shows sustained reduction in long-lived exceptions.
