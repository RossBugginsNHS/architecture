description: Stakeholder Involvement

requirement: |
  There **SHOULD** be effective and commensurate stakeholder involvement with respect to solution design and architecture decisions.

  Objective:
    Embed the right stakeholders at the right time so design decisions balance
    user needs, operational realities, governance expectations and strategic fit.

  Stakeholder mapping:
    - Categorise: Decision makers, Influencers, Contributors, Informed
    - Map to decision types (strategic, security, data, UX, operational)
    - Identify escalation & approval pathways early

  Engagement cadence:
    - Lightweight design huddles (weekly) for emerging decisions
    - Formal checkpoints aligned to stage gates or risk thresholds
    - Async review packs (concise deltas) to reduce meeting load

  Artefacts supporting involvement:
    - RACI / responsibility matrix for key decision domains
    - Decision calendar (upcoming major choices & needed inputs)
    - Feedback log (captures challenge & resolution)

  Pitfalls:
    - Token representation (stakeholder attends, no meaningful input window)
    - Last-minute security / data privacy involvement causing rework
    - Decision diffusionâ€”no single accountable owner identified
