description: Stakeholder Involvement

requirement: |
  There **SHOULD** be effective and commensurate stakeholder involvement with respect to solution design and architecture decisions.

more_info: |
  Objective:
    Embed the right stakeholders at the right time so design decisions balance
    user needs, operational realities, governance expectations and strategic fit.

  Stakeholder mapping:
    - Categorise: Decision makers, Influencers, Contributors, Informed
    - Map to decision types (strategic, security, data, UX, operational)
    - Identify escalation & approval pathways early

  Engagement cadence:
    - Lightweight design huddles (weekly) for emerging decisions
    - Formal checkpoints aligned to stage gates or risk thresholds
    - Async review packs (concise deltas) to reduce meeting load

  Artefacts supporting involvement:
    - RACI / responsibility matrix for key decision domains
    - Decision calendar (upcoming major choices & needed inputs)
    - Feedback log (captures challenge & resolution)

  Pitfalls:
    - Token representation (stakeholder attends, no meaningful input window)
    - Last-minute security / data privacy involvement causing rework
    - Decision diffusion—no single accountable owner identified

examples:

        Upcoming: Select messaging broker (date, required attendees, pre-read link).
    - title: Feedback Log Extract
      content: |
        Structured list of stakeholder comments with disposition (accepted / rejected) & rationale.

assessment_guidance: |
  Assessment focus:
    Establish whether stakeholder involvement is timely, role‑appropriate and produces traceable influence on decisions.

  Steps:
    1. Review stakeholder map / RACI: verify coverage of security, data, operations, product, finance, clinical (if applicable) and user research.
    2. Select 3 recent significant decisions: inspect review timeline (were relevant stakeholders engaged before lock-in?).
    3. Examine feedback log entries: confirm resolution rationale recorded (accepted / declined with reason).
    4. Check escalation path clarity (is there a defined route for unresolved contention?).
    5. Interview sample stakeholder: do they perceive involvement as meaningful vs ceremonial?

  Evidence:
    - RACI matrix segment
    - Annotated decision review timeline
    - Feedback log snippet with dispositions
    - Escalation workflow diagram / description

  Red flags:
    - Late security/privacy sign-off forcing rework
    - Passive attendance (no recorded feedback) for critical roles
    - Decisions approved despite unresolved critical objections

  Maturity signals:
    - Time-to-feedback SLAs met >90%
    - Stakeholder satisfaction pulse (qualitative) trending positive
    - Audit trail linking stakeholder inputs to final decision text

  Quick improvements:
    - Introduce decision pre-read distribution checklist
    - Add feedback capture template with mandatory disposition
    - Rotate facilitator role to avoid bias & increase engagement

assessment_examples:
  '0':
    - example: No stakeholder mapping; critical functions (security, operations) uninvolved until late.
    - example: Decisions approved without recorded feedback or rationale.
  '1':
    - example: Informal list of stakeholders; sporadic invitations; feedback captured in chat not logged.
    - example: Late input causing rework on significant decisions.
  '2':
    - example: RACI drafted; coverage gaps (e.g. data privacy) still present.
    - example: Feedback log exists but incomplete; resolution rationale missing for some items.
  '3':
    - example: Comprehensive stakeholder map; timely involvement evidenced for most major decisions.
    - example: Feedback & dispositions logged; escalation path defined though rarely used.
  '4':
    - example: SLA for time-to-feedback met for majority (>85%) of sampled decisions.
    - example: Satisfaction / pulse feedback collected and trending positively; few late surprises.
  '5':
    - example: Analytics show >90% on-time stakeholder engagement with decreasing rework rate.
    - example: Feedback insights loop into continuous improvement (role coverage, cadence adjustments).
    - example: Traceable linkage from stakeholder comment to final ADR text for all sampled decisions.
