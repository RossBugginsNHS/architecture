description: Risk Management

requirement: |
  Architecture risks and issues **SHOULD** be managed effectively with the appropriate level of visibility and ownership.

  Aim:
    Provide proactive, transparent management of architecture risks and issues so
    that emerging threats to value, compliance or delivery are surfaced early and
    mitigated deliberately.

  Risk register essentials:
    - ID, concise statement (cause -> event -> effect)
    - Impact & likelihood scoring (consistent scale)
    - Inherent vs residual risk after mitigation
    - Mitigation action(s) & owners
    - Review cadence & next review date
    - Link to related debt / decisions / dependencies

  Integration:
    - Architecture risks join enterprise or programme register (not siloed)
    - Issues escalate from triggered risk or unplanned event
    - Dependencies tracked with lead time & failure mode analysis

  Metrics:
    - Risk burn-down (count of high severity over time)
    - % risks with active, funded mitigation
    - Average time open (high severity)
    - Residual risk trend vs target appetite

  Pitfalls:
    - Vague risk descriptions (no clear trigger / consequence)
    - Static register (no regular re-assessment)
    - Treating issues as risks or duplicating in multiple un-synchronised logs

examples: 
    - title: Architecture Risk Entry

        ID: ARCH-RISK-07  Statement: If legacy identity service is not replaced
        before user growth phase, then authentication latency will breach SLA.
        Impact: High  Likelihood: Medium  Mitigation: Phase migration plan.
    - title: Residual Risk Heatmap
      content: |

    - title: Linked Dependency Ticket
      content: |

assessment_guidance: |
  Assessment focus:
    Determine if architecture risks are specific, dynamic, linked to mitigations & decisions, and proportionally addressed.

  Steps:
    1. Sample 5 open risks: validate each statement follows Cause → Event → Impact clarity and has both inherent and residual scoring.
    2. Check last_reviewed dates vs defined cadence; compute % overdue.
    3. Trace 2 mitigations into delivery backlog; verify progress evidence & effectiveness reassessment.
    4. Cross-check top risks against debt register & decision log (are relationships captured?).
    5. Inspect recent incidents: were any unanticipated (missing from register) → indicates detection gap.

  Evidence:
    - Risk register extract with sampled entries
    - Overdue rate & trend
    - Mitigation ticket links with status
    - Post-incident review referencing (or adding) risk entries

  Red flags:
    - Generic risks (“Technology may change”) without quantifiable trigger
    - High residual risk accepted without explicit sign-off
    - Identical review dates (batch update smell)
    - Mitigations phrased as vague intentions (“Improve performance”) lacking actions

  Maturity signals:
    - Automated risk dashboard (API-driven) not manually curated slides
    - Dynamic risk scoring adjusted after telemetry changes
    - Residual high risks have explicit conscious acceptance artefact

  Quick improvements:
    - Introduce linter validating risk statement pattern
    - Add webhook to update “last_reviewed” on mitigation change
    - Classify risks by thematic cluster to target structural fixes

assessment_examples:
  '0':
    - example: No distinct architecture risk register; issues & risks conflated; vague entries ("technology may fail").
    - example: No owners or review dates; stale critical exposures unnoticed.
  '1':
    - example: Basic list of risks with impact/likelihood but missing mitigation detail & residual scoring.
    - example: Review cadence ad‑hoc; several entries clearly outdated.
  '2':
    - example: Register includes mitigations & owners; residual scoring inconsistent or absent for many.
    - example: Limited linkage to debt / decisions; overdue reviews >25%.
  '3':
    - example: Majority risks (≥70%) have inherent & residual scores, clear mitigation actions and next review dates.
    - example: Links established to related debt, decisions and dependencies; overdue <20%.
  '4':
    - example: High severity residual risks actively tracked with trend metrics; overdue reviews <10%.
    - example: Mitigation effectiveness reassessed after action completion; dashboard automated.
  '5':
    - example: Dynamic scoring adjusts from telemetry / incident data; predictive indicators feed register.
    - example: Residual high risks formally accepted or mitigated within defined SLA; overdue <5%.
    - example: Cross-linking (risk ↔ decision ↔ debt) complete; portfolio heatmaps drive strategic remediation.
