description: Design Authorities

requirement: |
  The solution design and architecture decisions **SHOULD** be managed through local programme design authorities and TRG at the appropriate stages of the lifecycle. The relevant Lead Architects and Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) are engaged and are supportive.

  Aim:
    Provide proportionate governance through local design authorities and TRG
    (where applicable) to ensure coherence, reuse, compliance and strategic fit.

  Authority model:
    - Local Programme Design Authority: day-to-day contextual decisions
    - Enterprise / TRG: cross-cutting impact, strategic alignment, exceptions
    - Specialist forums: security, data, clinical safety as required

  Submission expectations:
    - Problem & context summary (why now, drivers)
    - Options & trade-off analysis (with recommendation)
    - Impact (cost, risk, reuse, decommissioned assets)
    - Compliance mapping (principles, standards, red lines)
    - Decision required & time sensitivity

  Flow:
    1. Pre-engagement (scoping) with lead architect
    2. Pack / ADR preparation (concise delta-oriented)
    3. Circulate pre-read (time-boxed async questions)
    4. Authority session: clarify, challenge, record decision
    5. Update artefacts & publish outcomes (including conditions)

  Pitfalls:
    - Overloaded central forum deciding operational minutiae
    - Slide-decks as source-of-truth (lose change history)
    - Decisions conditional but follow-up tracking absent

examples: 
    - title: Decision Pack Summary Page
      content: |
        Single page: context, options, recommendation, principle alignment, impacts.
    - title: Authority Decision Log Extract
      content: |
        Meeting date, decision ID, outcome (approved w/ conditions), actions & owners.
    - title: Condition Closure Evidence
      content: |
        Ticket referencing decision ID with artefact update PR.

technology:
    - title: Decision Register (Markdown / DB)
      content: |
        Canonical list of authority outcomes & status.
    - title: Virtual Board / Workflow Tool
      content: |
        Tracks submissions through stages (draft -> scheduled -> decided -> closed).
    - title: Automated Template Generator
      content: |
        Produces pack skeleton referencing principle catalogue.

assessment_guidance: |
  Assessment focus:
    Evaluate whether design authority processes deliver timely, high-quality, traceable decisions with managed conditions.

  Steps:
    1. Obtain authority decision log: sample 5 entries (mix of ages) for completeness (context, outcome, conditions, links).
    2. Identify conditional approvals: verify actions tracked to closure; any stale conditions?
    3. Measure lead time: submission date â†’ decision date across last 10 items; identify bottlenecks.
    4. Inspect one rejected or deferred submission: check clarity of remediation guidance.
    5. Confirm decisions propagate to artefacts (diagrams / ADRs updated within agreed window).

  Evidence:
    - Decision log excerpt with timestamps
    - Condition tracking board / ticket references
    - Lead time distribution (chart or table)
    - Updated artefact PR referencing decision ID

  Red flags:
    - Growing backlog of pending submissions
    - Repeated emergency decisions outside normal path
    - Conditions closed with no objective verification evidence

  Maturity signals:
    - Automated status dashboard (queue length, SLA adherence)
    - <10% decisions require escalation for quorum issues
    - Lightweight template differentials (delta-based updates) reduce cycle time

  Quick improvements:
    - Introduce submission quality checklist
    - Add service-level targets (e.g. 80% decisions within 10 working days)
    - Automate condition reminder notifications
