description: Wider Decision Making

requirement: |
    There **SHOULD** be an appropriate and functioning architecture decision making forum within the delivery team including other SMEs e.g. product, engineering etc. 

more_info: |
  Intent:
    Embed a cross-functional decision forum within the delivery team so that
    architecture choices integrate product, engineering, operational and user
    perspectives early.

  Forum characteristics:
    - Cadence aligned to decision velocity (e.g. weekly)
    - Time-boxed agenda: new proposals, updates, follow-up actions
    - Shared backlog of pending / upcoming decisions
    - Async pre-read distribution to maximise session focus

  Roles:
    - Facilitator: keeps flow & captures outcomes
    - Decision owner: presents context & recommendation
    - SMEs: security, data, ops, clinical, finance as needed
    - Recorder (can be automated): updates decision log / ADR

  Operating model:
    - Clear entry criteria (decision size, cross-domain impact)
    - Use lightweight template for submissions
    - Track SLA from proposal to decision (bottleneck visibility)
    - Publish outcomes & rationale within 24h

  Pitfalls:
    - Becoming a status meeting (avoid granular delivery updates)
    - Parking lot decisions with no follow-up accountability
    - Overloaded agenda causing rushed approvals
