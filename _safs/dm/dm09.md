description: Wider Decision Making

requirement: |
    There **SHOULD** be an appropriate and functioning architecture decision making forum within the delivery team including other SMEs e.g. product, engineering etc. 

more_info: |
  Intent:
    Embed a cross-functional decision forum within the delivery team so that
    architecture choices integrate product, engineering, operational and user
    perspectives early.

  Forum     - Cadence aligned to decision velocity (e.g. weekly)
    - Time-boxed agenda: new proposals, updates, follow-up actions
    - Shared backlog of pending / upcoming decisions
    - Async pre-read distribution to maximise session focus

  Roles:
    - Facilitator: keeps flow & captures outcomes
    - Decision owner: presents context & recommendation
    - SMEs: security, data, ops, clinical, finance as needed
    - Recorder (can be automated): updates decision log / ADR

  Operating model:
    - Clear entry criteria (decision size, cross-domain impact)
    - Use lightweight template for submissions
    - Track SLA from proposal to decision (bottleneck visibility)
    - Publish outcomes & rationale within 24h

  Pitfalls:
    - Becoming a status meeting (avoid granular delivery updates)
    - Parking lot decisions with no follow-up accountability
    - Overloaded agenda causing rushed approvals

examples: 
    - title: Decision Backlog Board
      content: |
        Columns: Proposed, In Review, Decided, Follow-up; cards reference ADR IDs.
    - title: Agenda Template
      content: |
        Sections: New Decisions, Updates, Actions Review, Emerging Risks.
    - title: Outcome Digest
      content: |
        Brief summary post shared to channel linking decisions & actions.

technology:
    - title: Kanban Board (Jira / GitHub Projects)
      content: |
        Visualises decision lifecycle & WIP limits.
    - title: ChatOps Bot
      content: |
        Posts decision outcomes & reminders to collaboration channel.
    - title: ADR Repository Integration
      content: |
        Auto-creates draft ADR from backlog card template.

assessment_guidance: |
  Assessment focus:
    Determine if the team-level decision forum accelerates high-quality choices without becoming a status or bottleneck ceremony.

  Steps:
    1. Review decision backlog board: assess flow (WIP limits? stalled cards?).
    2. Calculate average cycle time (proposal → decided) for last 10 items; identify outliers & root causes.
    3. Sample meeting notes / digests: confirm outcomes, rationale, and actions captured within 24h and reflected in ADRs.
    4. Observe or simulate a session (if feasible): evaluate focus on material decisions vs delivery minutiae.
    5. Check integration with wider governance (escalation criteria & examples of escalated vs retained decisions).

  Evidence:
    - Backlog cycle time metrics
    - Sample digest linking ADR IDs
    - Escalation examples (ticket references)
    - WIP / SLA policy definition

  Red flags:
    - Backlog accumulation without throughput trend awareness
    - Decisions made offline then retrospectively logged
    - High rework rate (frequent reversals) indicating inadequate stakeholder input

  Maturity signals:
    - Stable or improving cycle time distribution
    - Bot-generated digests auto-posted to collaboration channel
    - Forum metrics (throughput, rework, escalations) visible to team

  Quick improvements:
    - Introduce simple SLA & visualise breaches
    - Automate ADR draft creation when card enters “In Review”
    - Add monthly retrospective focusing on decision quality and latency

assessment_examples:
  '0':
    - example: No team decision forum; architectural choices ad‑hoc & undocumented.
    - example: Outcomes communicated verbally only; backlog of unclear pending decisions.
  '1':
    - example: Irregular meetings; agenda mostly status updates; limited recording of rationale.
    - example: Decision backlog board exists but stale / low throughput visibility.
  '2':
    - example: Regular forum cadence; backlog columns defined but cycle time not measured.
    - example: Summaries shared inconsistently; ADR creation lags outcomes.
  '3':
    - example: Consistent digests within 24h linking ADR IDs & actions; cycle time metrics tracked.
    - example: WIP limits applied; stalled items highlighted for escalation.
  '4':
    - example: Bot / automation creates ADR draft & posts outcome summaries; cycle time improving.
    - example: Escalation criteria defined & followed; low rework rate.
  '5':
    - example: Decision flow analytics (throughput, rework, ageing) surfaced on dashboard driving improvements.
    - example: Forum optimises latency & quality (median cycle time trending down); zero offline unrecorded decisions.
    - example: Continuous learning retro feeds adjustments to criteria / template & reduces reversals.
