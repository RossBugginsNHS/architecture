description: Architectural Debt

requirement: |
  Where a solution or part of solution is seen as tactical, short term or introduces / persists tech & architecture debt, remediation plans **SHOULD** be in place and agreed with the relevant stakeholders and governance groups. Architecture Debt **SHOULD** be identified with implications, rationale and future mitigation plans (recorded in an Architecture Debt Register) Plans **SHOULD** be realistic and funded.

more_info: |
  Intent:
    Make architecture / technical debt visible, owned, prioritised and funded so
    that tactical compromises do not silently become systemic risk.

  What qualifies as Architecture Debt (examples):
    - Deliberate deviation from a principle (documented rationale & sunset date)
    - Deferred NFR (e.g. resilience pattern not yet implemented)
    - Obsolete component retained to avoid short-term migration effort
    - Unmanaged duplication across domains / services

  Register essentials:
    - Unique ID & concise title
    - Description (impact, risk if unaddressed)
    - Root cause (decision link / constraint)
    - Mitigation / remediation approach
    - Target resolution (date or release)
    - Status (proposed, accepted, in-progress, mitigated, retired)
    - Owner role & last_reviewed date

  Prioritisation heuristics:
    - User / patient safety & regulatory exposure
    - Cost of delay (compound operational cost growth)
    - Strategic misalignment (blocks target architecture evolution)
    - Incident amplification potential

  Funding alignment:
    - Fold mitigation tasks into roadmap epics (not a separate "tech debt" bucket)
    - Use measurable exit criteria (e.g. legacy API retired, latency < X ms)
    - Surface cumulative remediation capacity vs total demand (burn-down)

  Metrics / KPIs:
    - Debt closure rate (items / month) vs introduction rate
    - % debt items with funded plan
    - Average age of active debt items
    - High-risk (severity) debt count trend

  Pitfalls:
    - Treating backlog tickets without impact statement as "debt"
    - Permanent "tactical" exceptions with no review trigger
    - Solving symptoms (local refactors) not root cause (architecture decision)

        Impact: Elevated operational cost & latency vs target event platform.

assessment_guidance: |
  Assessment focus:
    Determine whether architectural debt is consciously governed, funded and trending toward reduction—not merely enumerated.

  Steps:
    1. Obtain the current debt register export (raw YAML/CSV/Markdown) and count open vs mitigated vs retired items.
    2. Sample 5 recent (<= 90 days) and 5 older (> 180 days) items: verify each has rationale, impact, mitigation plan, target date, owner & linkage (ADR / risk / roadmap epic).
    3. Compare introduction vs closure rate over last 3 reporting periods—identify net burn-down or accumulation.
    4. Trace 2 funded remediation items into delivery backlog (story / epic alignment with measurable exit criteria).
    5. Inspect any “permanent tactical” items: challenge justification & review trigger.

  Evidence to capture:
    - Register snapshot (with aging distribution)
    - Trend chart: items added vs closed (last 6 months)
    - Example remediation epic referencing debt ID
    - One root cause analysis linking back to a prior decision

  Red flags:
    - High severity items without target resolution date
    - Repeated carry-forward of the same target date across reports
    - Generic titles (“Refactor module”) lacking impact articulation
    - Missing linkage to originating decision or constraint

  Maturity signals:
    - Automated metrics (age buckets, severity trend) generated from source repo
    - ≤10% of items past target date without approved extension
    - Clear categorisation (e.g. deliberate | inadvertent) aiding prioritisation
    - Funding allocation visible per mitigation cluster

  Quick remediation ideas (if weak):
    - Introduce mandatory front matter fields & linter for debt entries
    - Add a weekly script producing burndown and aging charts
    - Map top N high-impact items to explicit quarterly objectives
    - Enforce linkage: debt item cannot close until exit condition validated

assessment_examples:
  '0': |
    - No debt register; tactical compromises undocumented.
    - Team cannot enumerate top debt items or impact.
    - No linkage to decisions or funding.
      - Ad-hoc list of “tech debt” tickets with vague titles.
      - No impact / mitigation fields; aging unknown.
      - Closure / introduction trend not tracked.
  '2': |
    - Basic register exists (title, description) for some items.
    - Few have owners or target dates; high severity mixed with trivial tasks.
    - Some references to ADRs but inconsistent.
      - Structured register (IDs, impact, owner, target date) covering majority.
      - Aging & severity visible; introduction ≈ closure rate (stable backlog).
      - Funding links present for high-impact items; some stale entries.
  '4': |
    - Complete register; >85% items have funded mitigation & current target date.
    - Trend shows net burn-down; severity distribution improving.
    - Strong linkage to ADRs / risks; exception review cadence defined.
      - Automated metrics (aging, severity, cost exposure) surfaced in dashboard.
      - Debt introduction gate: new item requires rationale & mitigation proposal.
      - Continuous burn-down; high-severity items time-boxed with <5% overdue.
