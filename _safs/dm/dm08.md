description: Structured Decision Making

requirement: |
  All decision-making **SHOULD** be structured. E.g. identify key strategic drivers, user need assess options against drivers, present rationale, clarity on trade-offs, dependencies, risks and issues understood.

  Objective:
    Ensure material decisions follow a structured, transparent evaluation so
    selection is defensible and aligned to strategic drivers & user needs.

  Structured process:
    1. Frame decision (problem statement, scope boundaries)
    2. Identify drivers (strategic, user, compliance, constraints)
    3. Generate options (include baseline / do-nothing)
    4. Define evaluation criteria (weighted if appropriate)
    5. Assess options (qualitative + quantitative evidence)
    6. Recommend & record trade-offs (explicitly list discarded options)
    7. Capture follow-up actions and review triggers

  Evaluation criteria examples:
    - Alignment to principles / target architecture
    - Time-to-value & delivery risk
    - Operability / support model maturity
    - Cost profile (initial + run + exit)
    - Security / compliance posture
    - Reuse enablement & ecosystem fit

  Pitfalls:
    - Criteria retrofitted to justify pre-selected option
    - Ignoring intangible or ecosystem impacts (capability fragmentation)
    - Over-weighting short-term cost vs strategic resilience
