description: Spend Control

requirement: |
  Spend control (GaTS) and associated Government Digital Services & Service Design related guidance **SHOULD** be followed whilst developing the solution and be evidenced for service design & spend control reviews.

  Purpose:
    Ensure financial governance (GaTS / spend control) is integral to design
    evolution—not a late compliance gate—so architectural choices reflect cost
    transparency and value realisation.

  Core alignment areas:
    - Strategic fit & problem framing (business case coherence)
    - Options considered (including reuse / buy vs build)
    - Whole-life cost model (run + change + exit)
    - Benefit tracking approach & measurable outcomes
    - Risk & dependency profile (including market / vendor exposure)

  Evidence lifecycle:
    1. Early concept note ties capability gap to strategic objective
    2. Option appraisal (qual & quant) with TCO comparisons
    3. Preferred option rationale (trade-offs & rejected options)
    4. Incremental funding checkpoints linked to milestone value
    5. Post-implementation value realisation review

  Cost hygiene practices:
    - Tag infrastructure / workloads for cost allocation early
    - Model scaling cost vs projected usage (avoid surprise inflection)
    - Track cost per key transaction / user segment
    - Include decommissioning / migration expenses in TCO

  Pitfalls:
    - Treating spend control forms as paperwork after architecture decided
    - Optimising for procurement cost ignoring run/operations cost curve
    - Under-accounting for data egress / inter-service latency cost implications

  Assessment focus:
    Validate that architectural decisions internalise cost transparency, option appraisal and benefit realisation—not just satisfy a paperwork gateway.

  Steps:
    1. Review the latest option appraisal: confirm at least one reuse/do‑nothing baseline and explicit rejection rationale.
    2. Inspect TCO model inputs (run, change, exit, compliance overhead); challenge hidden assumptions (e.g. unpriced data egress / support tiers).
    3. Trace two architectural components to tagged cost dashboards: verify cost allocation granularity (service / environment / team).
    4. Examine benefit tracking artefact: ensure KPIs are leading and attributable (not only lagging financials).
    5. Check funding gates: sample one recently passed gate for evidence pack completeness (decision log, risk updates, cost variance analysis).

  Evidence:
    - Option appraisal comparison table
    - Extract of cost tags & monthly allocation report
    - TCO spreadsheet (sanitised) highlighting sensitivity analysis
    - Benefit realisation dashboard screenshot

  Red flags:
    - Single-option business cases
    - CapEx focus with opaque ongoing OpEx scaling assumptions
    - Large variance between forecast and actual with no corrective plan
    - No linkage between cost anomalies and architectural refactors

  Maturity signals:
    - Automated nightly ingestion of cost + usage metrics feeding forecast variance
    - Regular (e.g. quarterly) recalibration of TCO assumptions
    - Architecture runway items explicitly tied to cost optimisation hypotheses

  Quick improvements:
    - Add “assumptions & triggers” section to cost model
    - Introduce cost per key transaction KPI and publish trend
    - Embed FinOps review in decision template before approval

assessment_examples:
  '0': |
    - No spend control artefacts; cost considerations absent from design.
    - Cannot state current run rate or forecast.
      - Basic budget number known; no TCO or option appraisal.
      - Cost anomalies discovered reactively via invoice.
  '2': |
    - Option appraisal done once; limited alternatives.
    - Some tagging / allocation incomplete; major components untagged.
      - TCO model with assumptions; periodic (ad-hoc) variance review.
      - Cost per key transaction emerging; partial coverage.
  '4': |
    - Regular spend reviews; variance analysis drives optimisation backlog.
    - Option appraisals standardised; reuse vs build vs buy considered.
      - Continuous cost observability; automated anomaly detection & alerting.
      - Funding gates evidence value realisation; decommission costs included.
