description: Spend Control

requirement: |
  Spend control (GaTS) and associated Government Digital Services & Service Design related guidance **SHOULD** be followed whilst developing the solution and be evidenced for service design & spend control reviews.

  Purpose:
    Ensure financial governance (GaTS / spend control) is integral to design
    evolution—not a late compliance gate—so architectural choices reflect cost
    transparency and value realisation.

  Core alignment areas:
    - Strategic fit & problem framing (business case coherence)
    - Options considered (including reuse / buy vs build)
    - Whole-life cost model (run + change + exit)
    - Benefit tracking approach & measurable outcomes
    - Risk & dependency profile (including market / vendor exposure)

  Evidence lifecycle:
    1. Early concept note ties capability gap to strategic objective
    2. Option appraisal (qual & quant) with TCO comparisons
    3. Preferred option rationale (trade-offs & rejected options)
    4. Incremental funding checkpoints linked to milestone value
    5. Post-implementation value realisation review

  Cost hygiene practices:
    - Tag infrastructure / workloads for cost allocation early
    - Model scaling cost vs projected usage (avoid surprise inflection)
    - Track cost per key transaction / user segment
    - Include decommissioning / migration expenses in TCO

  Pitfalls:
    - Treating spend control forms as paperwork after architecture decided
    - Optimising for procurement cost ignoring run/operations cost curve
    - Under-accounting for data egress / inter-service latency cost implications
