description: Equality
requirement: We **SHOULD** treat internal (NHS England) and external consumers equally.
more_info: |
  Intent:
    Avoid creating privileged or degraded experiences—internal and external
    consumers should receive parity of capability, reliability and clarity unless
    explicitly and transparently differentiated.

  Equality dimensions:
    - Documentation depth & accuracy
    - Rate limits / quota fairness
    - Error clarity & remediation guidance
    - Support pathways / SLAs
    - Feature accessibility & release notes

  Practices:
    - Maintain single public contract; avoid private hidden endpoints
    - Publish changelog & deprecation timelines
    - Provide sandbox / test credentials consistency
    - Track usage analytics to detect disparity (latency, error rate)

  Pitfalls:
    - Internal teams bypassing published APIs with direct DB access
    - Fragmented documentation sets (internal Confluence vs external portal)
    - Undocumented throttling impacting external integrators only
examples:
- title: Unified API Portal Page
  content: 'Shows identical reference docs & SDK links for all consumers.

    '
- title: Changelog Extract
  content: 'Release entry describing new field with migration notes.

    '
- title: Fairness Metrics Panel
  content: 'Dashboard comparing internal vs external latency/error KPIs.

    '
technology:
- title: Developer Portal / Backstage

- title: Documentation Generator

  Assessment focus:
    Validate parity of experience (quality, performance, docs, support) across internal and external consumers.

  Steps:
    1. Compare documentation sets: confirm single-source generation (no divergent internal vs external manuals).
    2. Review rate limit & quota configurations: verify fairness rationale documented if asymmetric.
    3. Evaluate latency & error metrics segmented internal vs external; highlight disparities > agreed threshold.
    4. Inspect support workflow: tickets or issues—response SLAs consistent? Sample 3.
    5. Ensure no direct internal DB or backdoor access circumventing public API contract.

  Evidence:
    - Doc build artifact / portal screenshot
    - Rate limit config excerpt
    - Metrics comparison dashboard capture
    - Support ticket sample with timestamps

  Red flags:
    - Undocumented internal-only endpoints
    - Higher external error rates without remediation plan
    - Internal bypass paths causing inconsistent state mutations

  Maturity signals:
    - Fairness KPI (latency/error parity) tracked & improving
    - Automated check alerting on new undocumented endpoints
    - Unified changelog consumed by all consumers

  Quick improvements:
    - Introduce parity scorecard published each release
    - Add gateway policy forbidding unregistered endpoints
    - Segment analytics dashboards by consumer class
assessment_examples:
  '0':
  - example: Separate undocumented internal endpoints with elevated capabilities;
      no external parity consideration.
  - example: External consumers experience higher latency & errors unmonitored.
  '1':
  - example: Docs partially duplicated internally; external changelog lags behind.
  - example: Basic rate limiting configured inconsistently with no rationale.
  '2':
  - example: Move toward single-source docs; initial latency parity metrics captured
      manually.
  - example: Known undocumented endpoints scheduled for deprecation.
  '3':
  - example: Unified documentation pipeline; latency & error parity dashboards with
      thresholds.
  - example: Support SLAs measured across internal/external tickets; variance addressed.
  '4':
  - example: Automated detection of unregistered endpoints blocks deployment; fairness
      KPI trending positive.
  - example: Changelog automation ensures simultaneous publication.
  '5':
  - example: Continuous parity scoring integrated into release gates; disparities
      auto-create remediation tasks.
  - example: Consumer satisfaction metrics (NPS / survey) incorporated into equality
      score.
