description: Equality

requirement: |
  We **SHOULD** treat internal (NHS England) and external consumers equally.

more_info: |
  Intent:
    Avoid creating privileged or degraded experiences—internal and external
    consumers should receive parity of capability, reliability and clarity unless
    explicitly and transparently differentiated.

  Equality dimensions:
    - Documentation depth & accuracy
    - Rate limits / quota fairness
    - Error clarity & remediation guidance
    - Support pathways / SLAs
    - Feature accessibility & release notes

  Practices:
    - Maintain single public contract; avoid private hidden endpoints
    - Publish changelog & deprecation timelines
    - Provide sandbox / test credentials consistency
    - Track usage analytics to detect disparity (latency, error rate)

  Pitfalls:
    - Internal teams bypassing published APIs with direct DB access
    - Fragmented documentation sets (internal Confluence vs external portal)
    - Undocumented throttling impacting external integrators only

examples: 
    - title: Unified API Portal Page
      content: |
        Shows identical reference docs & SDK links for all consumers.
    - title: Changelog Extract
      content: |
        Release entry describing new field with migration notes.
    - title: Fairness Metrics Panel
      content: |
        Dashboard comparing internal vs external latency/error KPIs.

technology:
    - title: Developer Portal / Backstage
      content: |
        Centralised API catalogue & docs parity.
    - title: API Analytics Platform
      content: |
        Segments usage by consumer type for fairness insight.
    - title: Documentation Generator
      content: |
        Builds consistent reference from single source contract.

assessment_guidance: |
  Assessment focus:
    Validate parity of experience (quality, performance, docs, support) across internal and external consumers.

  Steps:
    1. Compare documentation sets: confirm single-source generation (no divergent internal vs external manuals).
    2. Review rate limit & quota configurations: verify fairness rationale documented if asymmetric.
    3. Evaluate latency & error metrics segmented internal vs external; highlight disparities > agreed threshold.
    4. Inspect support workflow: tickets or issues—response SLAs consistent? Sample 3.
    5. Ensure no direct internal DB or backdoor access circumventing public API contract.

  Evidence:
    - Doc build artifact / portal screenshot
    - Rate limit config excerpt
    - Metrics comparison dashboard capture
    - Support ticket sample with timestamps

  Red flags:
    - Undocumented internal-only endpoints
    - Higher external error rates without remediation plan
    - Internal bypass paths causing inconsistent state mutations

  Maturity signals:
    - Fairness KPI (latency/error parity) tracked & improving
    - Automated check alerting on new undocumented endpoints
    - Unified changelog consumed by all consumers

  Quick improvements:
    - Introduce parity scorecard published each release
    - Add gateway policy forbidding unregistered endpoints
    - Segment analytics dashboards by consumer class
