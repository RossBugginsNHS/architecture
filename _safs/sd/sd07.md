description: Equality

requirement: |
  We **SHOULD** treat internal (NHS England) and external consumers equally.

more_info: |
  Intent:
    Avoid creating privileged or degraded experiencesâ€”internal and external
    consumers should receive parity of capability, reliability and clarity unless
    explicitly and transparently differentiated.

  Equality dimensions:
    - Documentation depth & accuracy
    - Rate limits / quota fairness
    - Error clarity & remediation guidance
    - Support pathways / SLAs
    - Feature accessibility & release notes

  Practices:
    - Maintain single public contract; avoid private hidden endpoints
    - Publish changelog & deprecation timelines
    - Provide sandbox / test credentials consistency
    - Track usage analytics to detect disparity (latency, error rate)

  Pitfalls:
    - Internal teams bypassing published APIs with direct DB access
    - Fragmented documentation sets (internal Confluence vs external portal)
    - Undocumented throttling impacting external integrators only

examples: 
    - title: Unified API Portal Page

        Release entry describing new field with migration notes.
    - title: Fairness Metrics Panel
      content: |
        Dashboard comparing internal vs external latency/error KPIs.

technology:
    - title: Developer Portal / Backstage
      content: |
        Centralised API catalogue & docs parity.
    - title: API Analytics Platform
      content: |
        Segments usage by consumer type for fairness insight.
    - title: Documentation Generator
      content: |
