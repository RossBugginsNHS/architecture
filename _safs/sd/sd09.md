description: API Standards

requirement: |
  We **SHOULD** adopt the right standards for API development, supported by user, consumer, and market / supplier engagement.

more_info: |
  Intent:
    Align API implementations to appropriate standards & style guides so
    consumers experience predictable behaviour, interoperability and reduced
    onboarding friction.

  Standards considerations:
    - API style (REST maturity, resource modelling, naming conventions)
    - Authentication & authorisation (OAuth2 / OIDC flows)
    - Error payload format & problem taxonomy
    - Pagination, filtering, sorting conventions
    - Content negotiation & version strategy
    - Security headers & TLS policies

  Adoption approach:
    - Maintain published style guide & lint rules
    - Integrate contract linting in CI pipeline
    - Provide reference implementation / SDK exemplars
    - Track exceptions with rationale & revisit date

  Pitfalls:
    - Proliferation of bespoke conventions (filter syntax, date formats)
    - Breaking changes labelled as minor (semantic version misuse)
    - Hidden security requirement variance across endpoints

examples: 
    - title: Lint Report Excerpt
      content: |
        Spectral run highlighting naming & error schema deviations.
    - title: Version Negotiation Example
      content: |
        Clients specifying Accept header with structured version token.
    - title: Standardised Error Payload
      content: |
        JSON object with type, title, correlationId and remediation guidance.

technology:
    - title: Spectral / OpenAPI Linter
      content: |
        Enforces style & error schema conventions.
    - title: SDK Generator (OpenAPI Generator / AutoRest)
      content: |
        Produces consistent client libraries.
    - title: Security Scanners (ZAP / Dependency Check)
      content: |
        Validates compliance with security standards.

assessment_guidance: |
  Assessment focus:
    Verify API standards adoption is enforced consistently and exceptions are controlled with lifecycle visibility.

  Steps:
    1. Run or view latest lint report: ensure no critical unresolved violations for new endpoints.
    2. Sample 3 endpoints: compare actual responses vs documented schema (status codes, error format consistency).
    3. Examine exception list: are rationales + expiry/review dates present? Check at least one resolution example.
    4. Inspect authentication & security headers across sample endpoints for uniformity.
    5. Validate versioning and content negotiation practices align with standard (e.g. Accept header usage documented & implemented).

  Evidence:
    - Lint report excerpt
    - Response vs schema diff snippet
    - Exception item & closure ticket
    - Auth/security header comparison table

  Red flags:
    - Repeated waiver of same rule (rule misfit or team avoidance)
    - Divergent error envelope structures
    - Undocumented custom query / filter semantics

  Maturity signals:
    - Auto-generated standards compliance badge per service
    - Declining exception backlog with meaningful root cause analysis
    - Standard change announcements trigger impact analysis tasks

  Quick improvements:
    - Introduce pre-merge failing gate for high-severity lint errors
    - Build standard-reference snippet library for common patterns
    - Establish monthly standards drift report
