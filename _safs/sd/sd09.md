description: API Standards

requirement: |
  We **SHOULD** adopt the right standards for API development, supported by user, consumer, and market / supplier engagement.

more_info: |
  Intent:
    Align API implementations to appropriate standards & style guides so
    consumers experience predictable behaviour, interoperability and reduced
    onboarding friction.

  Standards considerations:
    - API style (REST maturity, resource modelling, naming conventions)
    - Authentication & authorisation (OAuth2 / OIDC flows)
    - Error payload format & problem taxonomy
    - Pagination, filtering, sorting conventions
    - Content negotiation & version strategy
    - Security headers & TLS policies

  Adoption approach:
    - Maintain published style guide & lint rules
    - Integrate contract linting in CI pipeline
    - Provide reference implementation / SDK exemplars
    - Track exceptions with rationale & revisit date

  Pitfalls:
    - Proliferation of bespoke conventions (filter syntax, date formats)
    - Breaking changes labelled as minor (semantic version misuse)
    - Hidden security requirement variance across endpoints

examples: 
    - title: Lint Report Excerpt
      content: |
        Spectral run highlighting naming & error schema deviations.
    - title: Version Negotiation Example
      content: |
        Clients specifying Accept header with structured version token.
    - title: Standardised Error Payload
      content: |
        JSON object with type, title, correlationId and remediation guidance.

technology:
    - title: Spectral / OpenAPI Linter
      content: |
        Enforces style & error schema conventions.
    - title: SDK Generator (OpenAPI Generator / AutoRest)
      content: |
        Produces consistent client libraries.
    - title: Security Scanners (ZAP / Dependency Check)
      content: |
        Validates compliance with security standards.
