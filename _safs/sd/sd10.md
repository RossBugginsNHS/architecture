description: API Lifecycle

requirement: |
  The API follows the lifecycle policy best practice as set out within Sunsetting (deprecation and retirement) policy (Confluence). This **SHOULD** include any enforcement arrangements.

more_info: |
  Goal:
    Manage API evolution predictably—ensuring consumers have clarity on version
    introduction, support windows, deprecation and retirement timelines.

  Lifecycle policy elements:
    - Versioning scheme (semantic / date-based)
    - Support horizon per major version
    - Deprecation signalling (headers, docs, email, portal notices)
    - Sunset policy (notification intervals, final disable date)
    - Backwards compatibility guarantees

  Operational levers:
    - Usage analytics to detect stale / low-traffic versions
    - Automated diffing to flag breaking change proposals
    - Canary / shadow deployment for new version validation
    - Contract tests across active versions

  Pitfalls:
    - Implicit breaking changes (enum narrowing, field semantic shifts)
    - Infinite retention of legacy versions (maintenance drag)
    - No consumer impact analysis before deprecation

examples: 
    - title: Version Support Matrix
      content: |
        Table listing versions, release date, support end date, status.
    - title: Deprecation Notification Email
      content: |
        Templated notice with rationale, timeline, migration guide link.
    - title: Breaking Change Diff Report
      content: |
        Output highlighting removed fields & type changes requiring major bump.

technology:
    - title: API Management Platform
      content: |
        Tracks usage & injects deprecation headers.
    - title: Contract Diff Tool (OpenAPI Diff)
      content: |
        Detects breaking change classes automatically.
    - title: Canary Deployment Framework
      content: |
        Gradual exposure & rollback safety.

assessment_guidance: |
  Assessment focus:
    Determine if API lifecycle management is proactive, transparent and data-driven.

  Steps:
    1. Review version support matrix: ensure each version has release + planned end-of-support dates (no indefinite legacy).
    2. Examine deprecation communications: sample email / portal notice and header injection; verify timeline lead meets policy.
    3. Compare usage analytics: percentage of traffic still on deprecated versions—assess migration plan.
    4. Run contract diff between consecutive major versions: confirm breaking changes documented with migration guidance.
    5. Inspect enforcement plan: evidence of retirement actions (rate limiting / blocking) scheduled or executed.

  Evidence:
    - Version matrix snapshot
    - Deprecation notice artifact
    - Usage distribution graph
    - Contract diff summary

  Red flags:
    - Orphan legacy versions with no retirement plan
    - Breaking changes shipped without major version increment
    - Consumers surprised by removals (incident or support spike)

  Maturity signals:
    - Automated stale-version reminder emails
    - Regression guard detecting unintended breaking changes
    - SLA for consumer notification consistently met (>95%)

  Quick improvements:
    - Add automated traffic threshold trigger to initiate deprecation workflow
    - Implement version sunset countdown dashboard
    - Include migration checklist in deprecation template
