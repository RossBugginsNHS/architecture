description: External Policies

requirement: |
  Solutions **SHOULD** adhere to: Government "Secure by Design" policy NCSC CAF Access Control Guidelines Policy - Strong Auth/MFA Storage and Processing of Data Outside of the UK - Information Governance Policy NHS England's API strategy and policy statements. E.g. API Landscape policy document (Word, Aalto.digital.nhs.uk) (Note there are overlaps with the Engineering red lines; ensure a consistent response and do not repeat assessments)

  Intent:
    Embed external policy & regulatory compliance directly into architecture
    design decisions and delivery processes (shift-left), avoiding late-stage
    remediation.

  Policy integration steps:
    1. Curate applicable policy catalogue (secure by design, API strategy, IG)
    2. Classify applicability per component / data domain
    3. Translate into testable controls (policy as code / checklist)
    4. Automate baseline scanning (CI) & manual attestation for subjective areas
    5. Evidence mapping & retention (auditable trail)

  Control categories:
    - Identity / access (MFA, least privilege)
    - Data protection (encryption at rest / transit, residency)
    - Logging & monitoring (centralised, tamper evident)
    - Secure development (dependency hygiene, SAST/DAST)
    - Change & release (segregation of duties, traceability)

  Pitfalls:
    - Treating policy docs as static attachments instead of codifying controls
    - Divergent interpretations across teams (no central catalogue)
    - Manual evidence collation during audit crunch periods

examples: 
    - title: Policy Control Mapping Table
      content: |
        Row: Policy Clause -> Control ID -> Evidence Link -> Status.
    - title: Automated Security Scan Report
      content: |
        Pipeline output summarising dependency & static analysis findings.
    - title: Exception Justification Record
      content: |
        Document granting time-bound waiver with compensating controls.

technology:
    - title: Policy as Code Engine (OPA)
      content: |
        Enforces infrastructure & config compliance.
    - title: SAST/DAST Tooling
      content: |
        Continuous scanning of code and running services.
    - title: Central Evidence Store
      content: |
        Versioned repository of control evidence & audit artefacts.
