description: External Policies

requirement: |
  Solutions **SHOULD** adhere to: Government "Secure by Design" policy NCSC CAF Access Control Guidelines Policy - Strong Auth/MFA Storage and Processing of Data Outside of the UK - Information Governance Policy NHS England's API strategy and policy statements. E.g. API Landscape policy document (Word, Aalto.digital.nhs.uk) (Note there are overlaps with the Engineering red lines; ensure a consistent response and do not repeat assessments)

  Intent:
    Embed external policy & regulatory compliance directly into architecture
    design decisions and delivery processes (shift-left), avoiding late-stage
    remediation.

  Policy integration steps:
    1. Curate applicable policy catalogue (secure by design, API strategy, IG)
    2. Classify applicability per component / data domain
    3. Translate into testable controls (policy as code / checklist)
    4. Automate baseline scanning (CI) & manual attestation for subjective areas
    5. Evidence mapping & retention (auditable trail)

  Control categories:
    - Identity / access (MFA, least privilege)
    - Data protection (encryption at rest / transit, residency)
    - Logging & monitoring (centralised, tamper evident)
    - Secure development (dependency hygiene, SAST/DAST)
    - Change & release (segregation of duties, traceability)

  Pitfalls:
    - Treating policy docs as static attachments instead of codifying controls
    - Divergent interpretations across teams (no central catalogue)
    - Manual evidence collation during audit crunch periods

examples: 
    - title: Policy Control Mapping Table
      content: |
        Row: Policy Clause -> Control ID -> Evidence Link -> Status.
    - title: Automated Security Scan Report
      content: |
        Pipeline output summarising dependency & static analysis findings.
    - title: Exception Justification Record
      content: |
        Document granting time-bound waiver with compensating controls.

technology:
    - title: Policy as Code Engine (OPA)
      content: |
        Enforces infrastructure & config compliance.
    - title: SAST/DAST Tooling
      content: |
        Continuous scanning of code and running services.
    - title: Central Evidence Store
      content: |
        Versioned repository of control evidence & audit artefacts.

assessment_guidance: |
  Assessment focus:
    Evaluate how external policies are translated into enforceable, monitored controls with traceable evidence & exception lifecycle.

  Steps:
    1. Review policy control mapping table: verify each clause has Control ID + Evidence link + Status (not generic 'Covered').
    2. Sample 2 controls marked Implemented: open evidence artifact (scan report, config) ensure recency & authenticity (timestamp, hash).
    3. Inspect open exceptions/waivers: confirm compensating controls & expiry dates.
    4. Run pipeline or view last run for automated security scans; confirm gating on severity threshold.
    5. Trace one architectural decision referencing a policy trade-off (e.g. encryption approach) showing rationale.

  Evidence:
    - Mapping table excerpt
    - Scan report snippet with pass/fail metrics
    - Exception record with mitigation
    - Decision log entry referencing policy clause

  Red flags:
    - Large cluster of controls relying on manual attestation only
    - Evidence links to outdated reports (> defined recency SLA)
    - Exceptions auto-renewing without risk review

  Maturity signals:
    - Control coverage dashboard updated on commit
    - Declining number of manual-only controls (automation adoption)
    - Exception backlog ageing downward

  Quick improvements:
    - Add control evidence schema & validator
    - Implement notification for evidence nearing staleness
    - Introduce periodic policy drift review meeting

assessment_examples:
  "0":
    - example: External policy obligations not catalogued; compliance asserted verbally.
    - example: No control mapping or evidence repository.
  "1":
    - example: Initial policy list compiled; mapping table sparse with generic status.
    - example: Evidence documents stored ad-hoc without versioning.
  "2":
    - example: Control mapping table populated; some evidence links present; exception process informal.
    - example: Automated scans run but results not tied to control IDs.
  "3":
    - example: All controls mapped with Evidence, Status, Owner; exceptions time-bound with compensating controls.
    - example: Scan outputs linked to control IDs; remediation tickets raised.
  "4":
    - example: Dashboard tracks control coverage & exception ageing; stale evidence alerts integrated.
    - example: Policy changes trigger impact review tasks automatically.
  "5":
    - example: Continuous compliance pipeline updates control status; exceptions auto-escalate pre-expiry.
    - example: Risk reduction metrics correlate closed actions with incident trend improvements.
