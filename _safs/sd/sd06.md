description: API First

requirement: |
  An API First design methodology **SHOULD** be followed, where APIs are at the forefront of the design process, functionality and data is exposed via APIs and the needs of the API consumer have been considered.

more_info: |
  Goal:
    Treat APIs as first-class productsâ€”well-designed interfaces enabling secure,
    evolvable integration and decoupling of internal and external consumers.

  API-first practices:
    - Design & review schema / contract before implementation
    - Consumer interviews to validate use cases & error semantics
    - Explicit versioning & deprecation policy (sunset headers / timeline)
    - Non-functional design (pagination, rate limits, latency budgets)
    - Consistent naming & error structure (problem+json or similar)

  Lifecycle stages:
    1. Ideation & stakeholder needs capture
    2. Contract draft (OpenAPI / AsyncAPI) + review
    3. Mock / sandbox & consumer feedback
    4. Implementation & automated conformance tests
    5. Observability instrumentation (metrics, traces)
    6. Version evolution & retirement governance

  Pitfalls:
    - Schema drift (code-first quick changes without contract update)
    - Non-breaking semantic changes treated casually (consumer impact hidden)
    - Lack of discoverability & usage analytics

examples: 
    - title: OpenAPI Design PR
      content: |
        Pull request containing initial contract with review comments & decisions.
    - title: Mock Consumer Test Report
      content: |
        Feedback from prototype app exercising sandbox endpoints.
    - title: Deprecation Notice Example
      content: |
        Header & documentation excerpt for retiring v1 endpoints.

technology:
    - title: OpenAPI / AsyncAPI Tooling
      content: |
        Contract source-of-truth enabling code generation & validation.
    - title: API Gateway / Management Platform
      content: |
        Rate limiting, analytics, security policy enforcement.
    - title: Contract Testing (Pact / Schemathesis)
      content: |
        Ensures provider & consumer alignment.
    - title: Observability Stack (Prometheus / Tempo)
      content: |
        Captures latency, error rate, usage metrics.

assessment_guidance: |
  Assessment focus:
    Ensure APIs are genuinely consumer-first, contract-driven and lifecycle-managed from design through production.

  Steps:
    1. Inspect latest OpenAPI / AsyncAPI PR: verify review comments exist & were addressed prior to implementation.
    2. Review mock / sandbox usage logs: confirm at least one external (or distinct internal) consumer tested before build completion.
    3. Evaluate versioning: list active versions & deprecation plan; check for undocumented breaking changes (contract diff reports).
    4. Examine observability: usage metrics segmented by operation & consumer type; latency/error SLO adherence.
    5. Sample two error responses: ensure consistent problem schema & correlation IDs.

  Evidence:
    - Contract review PR link with resolved threads
    - Sandbox interaction logs / test results
    - Version support matrix
    - Contract diff report excerpt

  Red flags:
    - Implementation-first endpoints preceding contract approval
    - Hidden private endpoints bypassing gateway governance
    - Multiple ad-hoc error formats

  Maturity signals:
    - Automated contract lint + breaking change gate in CI
    - Consumer adoption metrics and churn tracked monthly
    - Deprecation notifications instrumented with analytics (who still on vX)

  Quick improvements:
    - Add contract diff step pre-merge
    - Introduce consumer feedback template on sandbox portal
    - Implement error schema validator test
