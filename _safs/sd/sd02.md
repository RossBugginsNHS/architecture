description: Compliance

requirement: |
  The solution **SHOULD** be compliant with NHS England principles, policy, patterns and best practice.

  Goal:
    Ensure the design demonstrably aligns to published principles, policies,
    reference patterns and mandated governance artefacts—without rote compliance.

  Compliance approach:
    - Map each principle/policy to concrete design evidence (diagram, ADR, control)
    - Highlight intentional deviations with rationale & review date
    - Use automated checks where feasible (naming, tagging, API style)

  Evidence matrix fields:
    - Reference (principle ID / policy name)
    - Applicable? (Y/N with justification)
    - Evidence link (diagram / doc / code / control)
    - Conformance (Yes / Partial / Exception)
    - Notes / follow-up actions

  Pitfalls:
    - Duplicate assessment spreadsheets lost after approval
    - Binary pass/fail without capturing partial improvements
    - Out-of-date principle catalogue version referenced
