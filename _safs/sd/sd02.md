requirement: |
  The solution **SHOULD** be compliant with NHS England principles, policy, patterns and best practice.

  Goal:
    Ensure the design demonstrably aligns to published principles, policies,
    reference patterns and mandated governance artefacts—without rote compliance.

  Compliance approach:
    - Map each principle/policy to concrete design evidence (diagram, ADR, control)
    - Highlight intentional deviations with rationale & review date
    - Use automated checks where feasible (naming, tagging, API style)

  Evidence matrix fields:
    - Reference (principle ID / policy name)
    - Applicable? (Y/N with justification)
    - Evidence link (diagram / doc / code / control)
    - Conformance (Yes / Partial / Exception)
    - Notes / follow-up actions

  Pitfalls:
    - Duplicate assessment spreadsheets lost after approval
    - Binary pass/fail without capturing partial improvements
    - Out-of-date principle catalogue version referenced

examples:

      content: |
        Row: "Reuse Before Build" – Applicable: Y – Evidence: ADR-012 – Status: Partial (legacy component) – Action: migrate by Q2.
    - title: Exception Log Entry
      content: |
        ID, Principle, Rationale, Mitigation, Review Date, Owner.
    - title: Automated Policy Check Report

assessment_guidance: |
  Assessment focus:
    Verify principle/policy alignment is explicit, current, partially compliant items are tracked, and exceptions are time-bound with mitigation.

  Steps:
    1. Open the principle compliance matrix: ensure each relevant principle has Applicability + Evidence + Status (not blank or generic).
    2. Sample 3 'Partial' items: verify action item links & target dates exist.
    3. Inspect exception register: confirm each exception references originating principle and has a review date in the future (not expired).
    4. Check CI logs for policy-as-code executions; confirm failing rules block merges or produce actionable feedback.
    5. Cross-check principle catalogue version in matrix against official source to detect drift.

  Evidence:
    - Matrix excerpt with Partial/Exception rows
    - Exception record (showing rationale & mitigation)
    - CI pipeline output of policy checks
    - Principle catalogue version hash / commit

  Red flags:
    - Large volume of unreviewed or expired exceptions
    - Copy/paste evidence references (same doc for multiple unrelated principles)
    - Manual spreadsheet only—no automation for regressions

  Maturity signals:
    - Automated diff raising alert when principle catalogue updates
    - Trend metrics: Partial → Full closure rate
    - Exceptions half-life decreasing across quarters

  Quick improvements:
    - Add status_badge generation to site build for each principle
    - Enforce matrix schema via linter script
    - Add monthly exception review stand-up with summary report
