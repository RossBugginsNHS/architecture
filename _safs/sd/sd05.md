description: Reuse

requirement: |
  Solutions **SHOULD** focus on commodity products and services where possible/sensible.

  Intent:
    Maximise value delivery speed and resilience by using commodity & managed
    services; avoid bespoke build where reliable, cost-effective alternatives exist.

  Evaluation criteria for reuse vs build:
    - Core differentiator? (If no, prefer commodity)
    - Operational maturity & SLA vs required service levels
    - Integration friction & extensibility
    - Cost transparency (scaling / exit)
    - Compliance & data residency support

  Adoption steps:
    1. Survey existing platform capabilities & service catalogue
    2. Perform gap analysis vs use case requirements
    3. Document constraints / trade-offs (latency, config limits)
    4. Decide: adopt, extend, or justify build
    5. Track revisit trigger (scale, feature threshold, cost curve)

  Pitfalls:
    - Forcing fitâ€”excessive custom glue around ill-suited commodity tool
    - Hidden lock-in costs ignored until migration horizon
    - Building undifferentiated plumbing (queues, auth) from scratch

assessment_guidance: |
  Assessment focus:
    Validate reuse analysis rigor: ensure commodity service adoption decisions balance fit vs build justification and include revisit triggers.

  Steps:
    1. Review capability gap analysis: each unmet requirement should show mitigation or rationale for custom build.
    2. Inspect cost comparison (managed vs build): confirm inclusion of run, support, scaling, compliance, and exit cost.
    3. Verify at least one revisit trigger (e.g. sustained TPS, feature backlog growth) documented for chosen commodity service.
    4. Sample one adopted managed service: check SLAs match NFR targets & incident history assessed.
    5. Look for lock-in mitigation notes (data export, abstraction) where using higher-risk proprietary services.

  Evidence:
    - Gap analysis table extract
    - TCO / cost model highlight
    - Revisit trigger entry
    - SLA vs NFR comparison

  Red flags:
    - Build choice with no quantifiable differentiation benefit
    - Commodity adoption with hidden manual operational tasks reintroduced
    - Revisit triggers absent or expired

  Maturity signals:
    - Automated portfolio view of managed vs custom components
    - Revisit trigger outcomes logged & acted upon
    - Reuse percentage trend improving over releases

  Quick improvements:
    - Add lock-in risk scoring field to evaluation template
    - Automate cost model validation with actual spend ingestion
    - Schedule quarterly managed service fitness review
