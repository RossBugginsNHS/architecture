description: Reuse

requirement: |
  Solutions **SHOULD** focus on commodity products and services where possible/sensible.

  Intent:
    Maximise value delivery speed and resilience by using commodity & managed
    services; avoid bespoke build where reliable, cost-effective alternatives exist.

  Evaluation criteria for reuse vs build:
    - Core differentiator? (If no, prefer commodity)
    - Operational maturity & SLA vs required service levels
    - Integration friction & extensibility
    - Cost transparency (scaling / exit)
    - Compliance & data residency support

  Adoption steps:
    1. Survey existing platform capabilities & service catalogue
    2. Perform gap analysis vs use case requirements
    3. Document constraints / trade-offs (latency, config limits)
    4. Decide: adopt, extend, or justify build
    5. Track revisit trigger (scale, feature threshold, cost curve)

  Pitfalls:
    - Forcing fitâ€”excessive custom glue around ill-suited commodity tool
    - Hidden lock-in costs ignored until migration horizon
    - Building undifferentiated plumbing (queues, auth) from scratch
