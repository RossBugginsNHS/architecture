description: Well Architected Frameworks

requirement: |
  The relevant cloud "Well Architected Framework" **SHOULD** be followed, and the solutions assessed against it. AWS | Azure (Note there are overlaps with the Engineering Software Quality Framework; ensure a consistent response and do not repeat assessments)

more_info: |
  Goal:
    Systematically evaluate solutions against cloud Well-Architected pillars to
    surface improvement opportunities early and track remediation.

  Assessment cadence:
    - Baseline at initial architecture approval
    - Reassess per major release / significant scale change
    - Light-touch quarterly checkpoint for high-criticality services

  Pillar examples (AWS / Azure mapping):
    - Operational Excellence / Operational Excellence
    - Security / Security
    - Reliability / Reliability
    - Performance Efficiency / Performance Efficiency
    - Cost Optimization / Cost Management
    - Sustainability (where available)

  Output structure:
    - Pillar -> Question / Check
    - Current State Rating (e.g. 1â€“5 or Red/Amber/Green)
    - Risk / Impact Statement
    - Recommended Action (owner, target date)
    - Status Tracking

  Pitfalls:
    - One-off assessment (no iterative improvement)
    - Generic action wording (not implementable / measurable)
    - Ignoring sustainability / cost trade-offs in performance tuning
