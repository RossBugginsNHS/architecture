description: Standards

requirement: |
  The solution **SHOULD** be compliant with relevant standards.

more_info: |
  Intent:
    Provide explicit linkage between the solution and mandatory / voluntary
    standards (data, security, interoperability, clinical safety) to reduce
    integration friction and compliance risk.

  Standards mapping steps:
    1. Enumerate candidate standards (catalogue + domain SME input)
    2. Classify mandatory vs recommended vs out-of-scope
    3. Record implementation evidence / gaps
    4. Track remediation tasks for partial conformance

  Categories to consider:
    - Data formats & coding (FHIR, SNOMED CT, ICD, NHS number validation)
    - Security / cryptography (TLS versions, key management, hashing)
    - Accessibility (WCAG 2.2 AA)
    - Operational (logging, audit, resilience patterns)
    - Clinical safety (DCB standards where applicable)

  Pitfalls:
    - Listing standards without stating applicability or evidence
    - Unmanaged version drift (standard evolves, design assumptions stale)
    - Over-adoption (embracing optional standards without value case)

examples: 
    - title: Standards Applicability Table
      content: |
        Columns: Standard, Version, Mandatory?, Evidence, Gap, Action By.
    - title: FHIR Resource Coverage Log
      content: |
        List of required resource types with implementation status.
    - title: Accessibility Conformance Statement Stub
      content: |
        Summary referencing WCAG success criteria and test outcomes.

technology:
    - title: Standards Catalogue YAML
      content: |
        Machine-readable list powering validation scripts.
    - title: API Linter / Spectral
      content: |
        Validates OpenAPI against style & FHIR conventions.
    - title: Accessibility Testing Tools (axe / pa11y)
      content: |
        Automated baseline accessibility assessment.

assessment_guidance: |
  Assessment focus:
    Evaluate completeness & accuracy of standards mapping, ensuring version tracking, applicability clarity, and actionable remediation.

  Steps:
    1. Review standards table: each row should have Version + Applicability + Evidence or Gap + Action owner/date.
    2. Sample two 'Mandatory' standards with 'Partial' or 'Gap': verify remediation plan and prioritisation.
    3. Confirm version recency: compare recorded version vs external authoritative source.
    4. Inspect FHIR coverage log (if applicable): ensure resource/profile implementation status aligns with actual API schemas.
    5. Validate accessibility conformance statement includes test dates & tooling versions (not evergreen claims).

  Evidence:
    - Standards applicability excerpt
    - Gap remediation ticket links
    - Version comparison note
    - FHIR resource coverage snapshot

  Red flags:
    - Generic 'Compliant' status without evidence pointer
    - Outdated versions (>1 major behind) without risk note
    - No backlog items for high-impact gaps

  Maturity signals:
    - Automated nightly verification of standard versions
    - Dashboard summarising compliance posture (heatmap)
    - Integrating API lint results into standards matrix automatically

  Quick improvements:
    - Introduce YAML-driven standards list consumed by validation script
    - Add evidence_link_required rule in linter
    - Track % of Mandatory standards fully compliant over time
