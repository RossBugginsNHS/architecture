description: Design Principles

requirement: |
  Solution design **SHOULD** follow good practice design principles. E.g. Separation of concerns Encapsulation / Modularisation Loose coupling High cohesion / single responsibility Design for flexibility/change

  Goal:
    Achieve modular, evolvable architecture with clear responsibilities,
    minimised coupling and explicit variability points.

  Key principles (interpretation):
    - Separation of concerns: isolate orthogonal responsibilities (auth, routing)
    - Modularisation / encapsulation: internal details hidden behind stable APIs
    - Loose coupling: minimise synchronous, chatty dependencies; prefer contracts
    - High cohesion: components centred on a single functional purpose
    - Design for change: anticipate scaling, substitution, extension patterns

  Tactics:
    - Define dependency direction (acyclic where possible)
    - Use domain events to reduce direct temporal coupling
    - Introduce anti-corruption layers around legacy / external systems
    - Version public APIs with deprecation policy
    - Prefer composition over inheritance at service & code granularity

  Smells to watch:
    - Growing God Service / multi-purpose module
    - Tight release coordination across many components (temporal coupling)
    - Hidden shared databases bypassing service contracts
    - Duplicated cross-cutting logic (auth, logging) across services

    - title: Dependency Graph Extract
      content: |
        Directed graph showing acyclic service dependencies with event edges.
    - title: Anti-Corruption Layer Diagram
      content: |
        Wrapper service translating legacy schema into canonical domain model.
    - title: Cohesion Checklist Outcome
      content: |
        Evaluation sheet verifying each service's primary responsibility statement.

technology:
    - title: Static Analysis (Import Graph Tool)
      content: |
        Detects cyclic dependencies / layering violations.
    - title: Event Streaming Platform (Kafka / SNS)
      content: |
        Decouples producers & consumers through asynchronous contracts.
    - title: API Gateway
      content: |
        Centralises cross-cutting concerns & version negotiation.
