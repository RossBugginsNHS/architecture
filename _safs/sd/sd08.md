description: Patterns

requirement: |
  We **SHOULD** select the correct patterns for the use case, and any trade-offs justified and agreed.

more_info: |
  Goal:
    Deliberately select patterns (integration, data, deployment, resilience) that
    fit the problem characteristics; justify trade-offs & operational impact.

  Pattern selection workflow:
    1. Characterise use case (latency, consistency, scale, coupling tolerance)
    2. List candidate patterns (e.g. event-driven, request/response, CQRS)
    3. Evaluate against criteria (simplicity, resilience, cost, skill fit)
    4. Capture rationale & rejected alternatives
    5. Define success metrics (e.g. p95 latency, failure isolation scope)

  Common categories:
    - Integration (synchronous REST, gRPC, event streaming)
    - Data (CRUD, event sourcing, CQRS, replication)
    - Resilience (circuit breaker, bulkhead, backoff)
    - Deployment (blue/green, canary, rolling)
    - Caching (read-through, write-behind, edge cache)

  Pitfalls:
    - Pattern enthusiasm (introducing complexity w/o value)
    - Copying patterns from unrelated scale domain
    - Neglecting exit / simplification path if scale assumptions fail
