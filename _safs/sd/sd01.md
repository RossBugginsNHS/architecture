description: Design Methodology

requirement: |
  An appropriate design methodology **SHOULD** be followed e.g. Domain Driven Design and **SHOULD** include NHS/CDDO Service Design and Secure by Design principles and methods.

  Intent:
    Adopt a deliberate, shared design approach that shapes the solution around
    domain boundaries, user journeys, security and service principles earlyâ€”
    reducing rework and accidental complexity.

  Methodology alignment:
    - Domain Driven Design: ubiquitous language, bounded contexts, aggregates
    - Secure by Design: threat modelling, least privilege, zero-trust boundaries
    - NHS / CDDO Service Design: user needs, accessibility, service lifecycle

  Core activities & artefacts:
    - Context mapping (external systems, integration style, trust zones)
    - Event storming / workflow modelling to uncover domain concepts
    - Early non-functional surfacing (latency, resilience, privacy, cost)
    - Iterative architecture decision records (ADR) per significant pivot
    - Risk & assumption ledger updated per iteration

  Indicators of health:
    - Language consistency across code, docs & diagrams
    - Decisions traceable to explicit domain boundaries
    - Security & privacy controls embedded in design (not afterthought)

  Pitfalls:
    - Over-modelling before empirical validation (analysis paralysis)
    - Confusing physical deployment view with domain boundaries
    - Ignoring sociotechnical constraints (team structure misaligned to domains)
