description: Design Methodology

requirement: |
  An appropriate design methodology **SHOULD** be followed e.g. Domain Driven Design and **SHOULD** include NHS/CDDO Service Design and Secure by Design principles and methods.

  Intent:
    Adopt a deliberate, shared design approach that shapes the solution around
    domain boundaries, user journeys, security and service principles early—
    reducing rework and accidental complexity.

  Methodology alignment:
    - Domain Driven Design: ubiquitous language, bounded contexts, aggregates
    - Secure by Design: threat modelling, least privilege, zero-trust boundaries
    - NHS / CDDO Service Design: user needs, accessibility, service lifecycle

  Core activities & artefacts:
    - Context mapping (external systems, integration style, trust zones)
    - Event storming / workflow modelling to uncover domain concepts
    - Early non-functional surfacing (latency, resilience, privacy, cost)
    - Iterative architecture decision records (ADR) per significant pivot
    - Risk & assumption ledger updated per iteration

  Indicators of health:
    - Language consistency across code, docs & diagrams
    - Decisions traceable to explicit domain boundaries
    - Security & privacy controls embedded in design (not afterthought)

  Pitfalls:
    - Over-modelling before empirical validation (analysis paralysis)
    - Confusing physical deployment view with domain boundaries
    - Ignoring sociotechnical constraints (team structure misaligned to domains)

  Assessment focus:
    Determine if a coherent, living design methodology is actually influencing architecture outcomes (domain boundaries, security, service design) vs nominal adoption.

  Steps:
    1. Examine context / bounded context map: verify names used consistently in code repos, ADRs and docs (no drift or synonyms).
    2. Review two recent domain events: trace to aggregates / services & related decisions; confirm event naming aligns with ubiquitous language.
    3. Inspect threat model: ensure data flows & trust boundaries align with current architecture (no obsolete components).
    4. Sample 3 ADRs: each should reference domain or service design rationale (not purely technical stack choice) and security / privacy considerations where relevant.
    5. Check iteration logs or workshop notes (event storming, service blueprinting) for recent changes—if stale >6 months, methodology may be theater.

  Evidence:
    - Bounded context diagram snapshot
    - Event → Aggregate / Service trace example
    - Threat model excerpt with mitigation mapping
    - ADR cross-referencing domain / security rationale

  Red flags:
    - Context map mismatches deployment/service topology with no rationale
    - Security / privacy mitigations added late (post implementation)
    - Domain terminology inconsistent across code, docs, API contracts

  Maturity signals:
    - Automated check ensuring context names appear in repository taxonomy
    - Threat model delta PR created alongside design changes
    - Domain events feeding analytics / observability for feedback loops

  Quick improvements:
    - Add a design-methodology.md living index linking latest artefacts
    - Introduce ADR template sections: Domain Impact, Security Considerations
    - Schedule lightweight quarterly context alignment review
