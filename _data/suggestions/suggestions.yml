suggestions:
  - id: "SUG-001"
    category: "duplication"
    referenced_saf_ids: ["D03", "D06"]
    suggested_change: "Clarify scope boundary between D03 (Freshness) and D06 (Coverage) to remove duplicated catalogue language."
    rationale: "Both SAFs repeat artefact inventory concepts causing overlap and potential drift; D06 references itself in requirement text incorrectly."
    impact: "Reduces reader confusion; enables single source of truth for required artefact list."
    effort: "M"
    priority: "P1"
    dependencies: []
    notes: "Keep artefact list & catalogue ownership in D06; keep process & metrics (last_verified etc.) in D03; cross-link explicitly."
    status: "planned"

  - id: "SUG-002"
    category: "consistency"
    referenced_saf_ids: ["D06"]
    suggested_change: "Fix self-referential requirement in D06 to enumerate list via data include instead of repeating text 'as defined in D06'."
    rationale: "Current phrasing is circular and unhelpful; referencing itself gives no actionable scope."
    impact: "Clearer expectation; easier auditing."
    effort: "S"
    priority: "P2"
    dependencies: ["SUG-001"]
    notes: "Replace with 'as enumerated in documentation catalogue below'."
    status: "planned"

  - id: "SUG-003"
    category: "taxonomy"
    referenced_saf_ids: ["DM06", "DM07"]
    suggested_change: "Rename DM07 description from 'Architectural Governance' to 'Architecture Decision Records' and adjust tags."
    rationale: "DM06 already covers overarching governance; DM07 focuses on ADR practice but shares title causing ambiguity."
    impact: "Improves navigability; avoids misclassification in indexes."
    effort: "S"
    priority: "P1"
    dependencies: []
    notes: "Update nav link text and ensure inbound links updated."
    status: "planned"

  - id: "SUG-004"
    category: "metadata"
    referenced_saf_ids: ["S01", "S02", "S03", "S04"]
    suggested_change: "Standardise incomplete strategic SAFs by adding missing front matter fields: description, complete flag, todos removed or moved to backlog data file."
    rationale: "Some strategic SAFs hold inline TODOs; inconsistent use of complete: false; reduces professionalism and complicates rendering."
    impact: "Cleaner published site; enables programmatic completeness metrics."
    effort: "S"
    priority: "P2"
    dependencies: []
    notes: "Create _data/backlog/strategic_todos.yml and reference from guidance page instead of inline."
    status: "planned"

  - id: "SUG-005"
    category: "content-gap"
    referenced_saf_ids: ["SD04"]
    suggested_change: "Expand 'design_principles' list to include observability, security by design, performance efficiency, sustainability and testability or explain omission."
    rationale: "Current list references 'Etc.' which is vague; readers cannot rely on unspecified principles."
    impact: "Completeness; better alignment with other SAF pillars (e.g. NF01, NF04)."
    effort: "S"
    priority: "P2"
    dependencies: []
    notes: "Either enumerate explicitly or link to master principle catalogue."
    status: "planned"

  - id: "SUG-006"
    category: "consistency"
    referenced_saf_ids: ["NF02", "NF06"]
    suggested_change: "Harmonise RTO/RPO & resilience language (NF02 vs NF06) with shared glossary include."
    rationale: "Overlapping definitions of resilience and DR terms risk divergence; central glossary improves alignment."
    impact: "Reduced interpretive errors; easier audit."
    effort: "M"
    priority: "P2"
    dependencies: []
    notes: "Add _includes/glossary_resilience.md and reference in both."
    status: "planned"

  - id: "SUG-007"
    category: "duplication"
    referenced_saf_ids: ["SD06", "SD09", "SD10"]
    suggested_change: "Consolidate repeated API versioning & deprecation content into SD10, keep standards mapping in SD09, lifecycle methodology in SD06."
    rationale: "Versioning & deprecation appear in SD06 (API First) and SD09 (API Standards) and SD10 (API Lifecycle); centralising reduces redundancy."
    impact: "Easier maintenance; clearer responsibility boundaries."
    effort: "M"
    priority: "P1"
    dependencies: []
    notes: "Insert cross-links with anchors instead of duplicate bullet lists."
    status: "planned"

  - id: "SUG-008"
    category: "governance"
    referenced_saf_ids: ["DM05", "DM06", "DM04"]
    suggested_change: "Create a governance overview diagram linking stakeholder involvement, design authorities, and governance tailoring matrices."
    rationale: "Related SAFs describe pieces of governance without a unifying visual; readers cannot easily see flow."
    impact: "Improved comprehension and onboarding; highlights responsibility splits."
    effort: "M"
    priority: "P3"
    dependencies: []
    notes: "Use PlantUML or Mermaid for diffable governance_flow.puml."
    status: "planned"

    suggested_change: "Introduce a shared metadata schema (YAML) referenced by documentation-related SAFs for owner_role, last_verified, classification, status."
    rationale: "Multiple docs SAFs mention metadata; a formal schema file enables linters and reduces inconsistent field names."
    impact: "Enables automated validation and reporting."
    effort: "M"

    rationale: "Inconsistent metric nomenclature complicates dashboards & scripts."
    impact: "Easier automated aggregation."
