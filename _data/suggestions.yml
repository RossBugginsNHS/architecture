# Flattened suggestions data for simpler Liquid access
suggestions:
  - id: "SUG-001"
    category: "duplication"
    referenced_saf_ids: ["D03", "D06"]
    suggested_change: "Clarify scope boundary between D03 (Freshness) and D06 (Coverage) to remove duplicated catalogue language."
    rationale: "Both SAFs repeat artefact inventory concepts causing overlap and potential drift; D06 references itself in requirement text incorrectly."
    impact: "Reduces reader confusion; enables single source of truth for required artefact list."
    effort: "M"
    priority: "P1"
    dependencies: []
    notes: "Keep artefact list & catalogue ownership in D06; keep process & metrics (last_verified etc.) in D03; cross-link explicitly."
    status: "planned"
