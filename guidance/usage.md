As part of the BAU activities of Solution Architects working within delivery teams we will expect them to use the SaF to help structure their activities, their approach to solutions design, documentation and decision making. The SaF will act as an “aide memoir” for Solution Architects to drive a consistent approach, regardless of whether they are permanent, contract or supplier colleague.  

Further information and guidance will be developed on the specifics of the framework e.g. best practice document templates, non-functional requirement sets, good practice governance.  We will expect and positively encourage Solution Architects to actively contribute back into the framework and wider community of practice by developing supporting collateral.
