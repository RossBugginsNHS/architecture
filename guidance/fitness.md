Alongside day to day use we will require architects to perform periodic reviews of existing and products in development 

Solution Architects will be required to undertake a review of maturity/compliance against the requirements for each of the key products within their portfolios. 

Any review should not be done in isolation and should be done with the product owner and wider product team 

The review must be positioned as a helpful tool to highlight risks and issues 

The outcome of the assessments will be an architecture remediation plan.  Depending on the risks the remediation plan may be managed by the product team themselves as part of BAU or for high-risk assessments will be tracked by the appropriate governance group and Digital SLT.  This needs to be agreed collectively by the product team. 

Architecture assessment should be presented alongside wider dimensions including software quality framework and the engineering redlines.
