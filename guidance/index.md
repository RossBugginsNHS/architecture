The NHS England Solution Architecture Framework (SAF) is intended to describe what good looks like when developing the architecture which delivers our products and services by defining: 

A consistent approach to the design of solutions which delivers on user need, but also considers other key factors such as cyber security, service resilience, performance etc. 

- The artefacts Solution Architects should be producing 
- The processes and governance that should be implemented 

As well as describing what areas are important it also provides a baseline to assess the architectural fitness of our products and services. Alongside the assessment it provides a focus for risk mitigation.  

Full compliance is not expected, and a pragmatic approach needs to be taken which considers risk alongside other factors such as service criticality, user, patient impacts, architecture priority score, data classification etc. 

The architecture assessment is expected to be used alongside the NHS England Software Engineering Quality Framework. There are natural overlaps between these two frameworks and the engineering redlines. (Red lines (sharepoint.com)).  We think there will be great value in being able to articulate quality across the engineering and architecture perspectives to identify risks & issues in our priority services. 

There are also some overlaps with AWS and Azure Well Architected Frameworks. These frameworks should be used alongside the NHS SAF and will provide an evidence base for overall assessments. 

It be noted that additional material will be required to support the SAF e.g. creation of policy, patterns and best practice guidance to support decision making.  The SAF will provide the “headings” for the supporting collateral. 

We expect this document to be used alongside existing prescribed methodologies and standards such as CDDO checklists, Service Design Manual and other spend control related collateral.
